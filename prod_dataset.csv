How to Lose Friends & Alienate People,"By Young, Toby","In 1995 high-flying British journalist Toby Young left London for New York to become a contributing editor at Vanity Fair. Other Brits had taken Manhattan-Alistair Cooke then, Anna Wintour now-so why couldn't he? But things didn't quite go according to plan. Within the space of two years he was fired from Vanity Fair, banned from the most fashionable bar in the city, and couldn't get a date for love or money. Even the local AA group wanted nothing to do with him. How to Lose Friends and Alienate People is Toby Young's hilarious account of the five years he spent looking for love in all the wrong places and steadily working his way down the New York food chain, from glossy magazine editor to crash-test dummy for interactive sex toys. But it's more than ""the longest self-deprecating joke since the complete works of Woody Allen"" (Sunday Times); it's also a seditious attack on the culture of celebrity from inside the belly of the beast. And there's even a happy ending, as Toby Young marries-""for proper, noncynical reasons,"" as he puts it-the woman of his dreams.

The Religion: A Novel,"By Willocks, Tim","This is what we dream of: to be so swept away, so poleaxed by a book that the breath is sucked right out of us. Brace yourselves. May 1565. Suleiman the Magnificent, emperor of the Ottomans, has declared a jihad against the Knights of Saint John the Baptist. The largest armada of all time approaches the knights' Christian stronghold on the island of Malta. The Turks know the knights as the ""Hounds of Hell."" The knights call themselves ""The Religion."" In Messina, Sicily, a French countess, Carla La Penautier, seeks passage to Malta in a quest to find the son taken from her at his birth twelve years ago. The only man with the expertise and daring to help her is a Rabelaisian soldier of fortune, arms dealer, former janissary, and strapping Saxon adventurer by the name of Mattias Tannhauser. He agrees to accompany the lady to Malta, where, amid the most spectacular siege in military history, they must try to find the boy--whose name they do not know and whose face they have never seen--and pluck him from the jaws of Holy War. The Religion is the first book of the Tannhauser Trilogy, and from the first page of this epic account of the last great medieval conflict between East and West, it is clear we are in the hands of a master. Not since James Clavell has a novelist so powerfully and assuredly plunged readers headlong into another world and time. Anne Rice transformed the vampire novel. Stephen King reinvented horror. Now, in a spectacular tale of heroism, tragedy, and passion, Tim Willocks revivifies historical fiction."," Fiction , Historical",Sarah Crichton Books,"Tuesday, May 1, 2007",Price Starting at $10.99

Africa: The Challenge of Transformation,"By McCarthy, Stephen","Africa is portrayed by the world's media as a giant disaster area, plagued by civil war, ethnic and tribal conflict, natural and climatic catastrophes, famine and disease. Rural poverty is rife and burgeoning shanty-towns disfigure the outskirts of every African city. Yet travellers, including journalists, people in business and academics, are often struck by the timeless normality of African life and the survival of communities against all odds.This book does not conceal the huge problems, but examines them with empathy and suggests solutions. It stresses the extent to which there has already been positive political, economic and social progress - in particular, the gradual process of democratization and the growth of civil society. People are better educated and trained than ever before, and structural adjustment, despite its often brutal effects, has reduced over-blown state structures in several countries. Aid is now being channelled into stimulating local economic development and is no longer merely a """"top-down"""" exercise. Agricultural production is rising despite the droughts of the early 1990s and there is growing industrialization. This accessible and topical account provides a good introduction to some of the main issues."," Social Science , Sociology , General",I. B. Tauris,"Sunday, January 1, 1995",Price Starting at $4.99

The River Between Us,"By Peck, Richard","Richard Peck is a master of stories about people in transition, but perhaps never before has he told a tale of such dramatic change as this one, set during the first year of the Civil War. The whole country is changing in 1861-even the folks from a muddy little Illinois settlement on the banks of the Mississippi. Here, fifteen-year-old Tilly Pruitt frets over the fact that her brother is dreaming of being a soldier and that her sister is prone to supernatural visions. A boy named Curry could possibly become a distraction. Then a steamboat whistle splits the air. The Rob Roy from New Orleans docks at the landing, and off the boat step two remarkable figures: a vibrant, commanding young lady in a rustling hoop skirt and a darker, silent woman in a plain cloak, with a bandanna wrapped around her head. Who are these two fascinating strangers? And is the darker woman a slave, standing now on the free soil of Illinois? When Tilly's mother invites the women to board at her house, the whole world shifts for the Pruitts and for their visitors as well. Within a page-turning tale of mystery, adventure, and the civilian Civil War experience, Richard Peck has spun a breathtaking portrait of the lifelong impact that one person can have on another. This is a novel of countless riches."," Juvenile Fiction , Historical , United States , 19th Century",Dial,"Monday, September 1, 2003",Price Starting at $5.29

Nature's Numbers: The Unreal Reality of Mathematics (Science Masters Series),"By Stewart, Ian","Mathematics is, Ian Stewart admits, totally unreal - an entirely mental construct. Furthermore, the complicated equations and lengthy proofs we usually identify as math are no more the essence of math than a musical score is a Beethoven symphony. Yet math is the best tool we have for understanding the world around us. By looking at the universe through mathematical eyes, we have discovered a great secret: nature's patterns are clues to the deep regularities that govern the way the world works.Mathematics is to nature as Sherlock Holmes is to evidence. It can look at a single snowflake and deduce the atomic structure of ice crystals; it can start with a violin string and uncover the existence of radio waves. And mathematics still has the power to open our eyes to new and unsuspected regularities: the secret structure of a cloud or the hidden rhythms of the weather.Nature's Numbers will equip you with a mathematician's eyes. It will take you sight-seeing in a mathematical universe. And it will change the way you view your own world."," Mathematics , General",BasicBooks,"Saturday, July 1, 1995",Price Starting at $5.29

"Snark, It's Mean, It's Personal, and It's Ruining Our conversation","By Denby, David","What is snark? You recognize it when you see it -- a tone of teasing, snide, undermining abuse, nasty and knowing, that is spreading like pinkeye through the media and threatening to take over how Americans converse with each other and what they can count on as true. Snark attempts to steal someone's mojo, erase her cool, annihilate her effectiveness. In this sharp and witty polemic, New Yorker critic and bestselling author David Denby takes on the snarkers, naming the nine principles of snark -- the standard techniques its practitioners use to poison their arrows. Snarkers like to think they are deploying wit, but mostly they are exposing the seethe and snarl of an unhappy country, releasing bad feeling but little laughter.In this highly entertaining essay, Denby traces the history of snark through the ages, starting with its invention as personal insult in the drinking clubs of ancient Athens, tracking its development all the way to the age of the Internet, where it has become the sole purpose and style of many media, political, and celebrity Web sites. Snark releases the anguish of the dispossessed, envious, and frightened; it flows when a dying class of the powerful struggles to keep the barbarians outside the gates, or, alternately, when those outsiders want to take over the halls of the powerful and expel the office-holders. Snark was behind the London-based magazine Private Eye, launched amid the dying embers of the British empire in 1961; it was also central to the career-hungry, New York-based magazine Spy. It has flourished over the years in the works of everyone from the startling Roman poet Juvenal to Alexander Pope to Tom Wolfe to a million commenters snarling at other people behind handles. Thanks to the grand dame of snark, it has a prominent place twice a week on the opinion page of the New York Times.Denby has fun snarking the snarkers, expelling the bums and promoting the true wits, but he is also making a serious point: the Internet has put snark on steroids. In politics, snark means the lowest, most insinuating and insulting side can win. For the young, a savage piece of gossip could ruin a reputation and possibly a future career. And for all of us, snark just sucks the humor out of life. Denby defends the right of any of us to be cruel, but shows us how the real pros pull it off. Snark, he says, is for the amateurs."," Social Science , Popular Culture",Simon & Schuster,"Thursday, January 1, 2009",Price Starting at $5.29

"Through Our Enemies' Eyes: Osama bin Laden, Radical Islam, and the Future of America","By Scheuer, Michael (EDT)","All Americans must read this book in order to truly understand the reasons why radical Muslims like Osama bin Laden and his followers have declared war on America and the West. Furthermore, only this book accurately describes the severity of the threat they will continue to pose, with or without bin Laden’s leadership, to our national security.To win the war against terrorism, the author argues that we must first stop dismissing militant Muslims as “extremists” or “religious fanatics.” Formulating a successful military strategy requires that we must see the enemy as they perceive themselves—highly trained and motivated soldiers who fervently believe their cause is righteous. The author describes how militants throughout the Islamic world are enraged by what they believe is Western aggression against their people, religion, and culture. Though bin Laden declared war on America years ago—not once but twice—the author argues that American complacence in the face of such violent threats stems from the increasing secularization and moral relativism of American society and culture. Even if bin Laden is brought to justice, the author warns, the dangers posed by radical Islamic militants will not disappear, and we must be prepared for a protracted war against terrorism. This important book will make a major impact on how America thinks about its enemy and itself."," Political Science , Terrorism",POTOMAC BOOKS,"Saturday, February 1, 2003",Price Starting at $5.29

The Season of Second Chances: A Novel,"By Meier, Diane","A world of possibilities opens up for Joy Harkness when she sets out on a journey that’s going to show her the importance of friendship, love, and what makes a house a home Coming-of-age can happen at any age. Joy Harkness had built a university career and a safe life in New York, protected and insulated from the intrusions and involvements of other people. When offered a position at Amherst College, she impulsively leaves the city, and along with generations of material belongings, she packs her equally heavy emotional baggage. A tumbledown Victorian house proves an unlikely choice for a woman whose family heirlooms have been boxed away for years. Nevertheless, this white elephant becomes the home that changes Joy forever. As the restoration begins to take shape, so does her outlook on life, and the choices she makes over paint chips, wallpaper samples, and floorboards are reflected in her connection to the co-workers who become friends and friendships that deepen. A brilliant, quirky, town fixture of a handyman guides the renovation of the house and sparks Joy’s interest to encourage his personal and professional growth. Amid the half-wanted attention of the campus’s single, middle-aged men, known as “the Coyotes,”and the legitimate dramas of her close-knit community, Joy learns that the key to the affection of family and friends is being worthy of it, and most important, that second chances are waiting to be discovered within us all."," Fiction , Contemporary Women",Henry Holt and Co.,"Monday, March 1, 2010",Price Starting at $4.99

"Floods, Famines, And Emperors: El Nino And The Fate Of Civilizations","By Fagan, Brian M.","In 1997 and early 1998, one of the most powerful El Niños ever recorded disrupted weather patterns all over the world. Europe suffered through a record freeze as the American West was hit with massive floods and snowstorms; in the western Pacific, meanwhile, some island nations literally went bone dry and had to have water flown in on transport planes.Such effects are not new: climatologists now know the El Niño and other climate anomalies have been disrupting weather patterns throughout history. But until recently, no one had asked how this new understanding of the global weather system related to archaeology and history. Droughts, floods, heat and cold put stress on cultures and force them to adapt. What determines whether they adapt successfully? How do these climate stresses affect a people’s faith in the foundations of their society and the legitimacy of their rulers? How vulnerable is our own society to climate change?In this dazzlingly original new book, archaeologist Brian Fagan shows that short-term climate shifts have been a major?and hitherto unrecognized?force in history. El Niño-driven droughts have brought on the collapse of dynasties in Egypt; El Niño monsoon failures have caused historic famines in India; and El Niño floods have destroyed whole civilizations in Peru. Other short-term climate changes may have caused the mysterious abandonment of the Anasazi dwellings in the American Southwest and the collapse of the ancient Maya empire, as well as changed the course of European history.This beautifully written, groundbreaking book opens a new door on our understanding of historical events."," Social Science , Anthropology , General",Basic Books,"Tuesday, February 1, 2000",Price Starting at $5.29

Thus begins the saga of a woman born at the turn   of the century to a well-to-do, highly respected Chinese family, a woman who continually   defied the expectations of her family and the traditions of her culture. Growing   up in the perilous years between the fall of the last emperor and the Communist Revolution,   Chang Yu-i's life is marked by a series of rebellions: her refusal as a child to   let her mother bind her feet, her scandalous divorce, and her rise to Vice President   of China's first women's bank in her later years. In the alternating voices of two   generations, this dual memoir brings together a deeply textured portrait of a woman's   life in China with the very American story of Yu-i's brilliant and assimilated grandniece,   struggling with her own search for identity and belonging.

With painstaking scholarship and rigorous arguments, Mr. Smith examines, dissects, and refutes the myriad ""proofs"" offered by theists - the defenses of sophisticated, professional theologians, as well as the average religious layman. He explores the historical and psychological havoc wrought by religion in general - and concludes that religious belief cannot have any place in the life of modern, rational man.""It is not my purpose to convert people to atheism . . .

Staying Tuned: A Life in Journalism,"By Schorr, Daniel","He has covered and analyzed nearly every major event of our time: the founding of NATO, the building of the Berlin Wall, the 1950s McCarthy hearings, and the 1990s Clinton impeachment hearings. As both a national and international eyewitness, Daniel Schorr has spent six decades fully engaged in world-watching.  After opening the CBS bureau in Moscow in 1955 and arranging an unprecedented television interview with Soviet boss Nikita Khrushchev, Daniel Schorr went on to a career often revered and sometimes reviled. His no-holds-barred approach to reporting won him three Emmys for his coverage of Watergate, and landed him on Nixon's ""enemies list."" In the 1970s, his refusal to name sources regarding CIA and FBI misdeeds led to his being threatened with jail for contempt by the House Ethics Committee. Always probing, Daniel Schorr continues in his quest for the truth as the senior news analyst for National Public Radio®.  This amazing autobiography not only details the life and times of the octogenarian newsman -- the last of the legendary Edward R. Murrow news team still active in journalism -- but also poses some important questions about the future of media."," Biography & Autobiography , Political",Washington Square Press,"Monday, April 1, 2002",Price Starting at $4.99
Target Hitler: The Plots to Kill Adolf Hitler,"By Duffy, James P. and Ricci, Vincent L.","Target Hitler not only documents the plots of many individuals and groups who actively opposed the Nazis, it acknowledges the perseverance of Nazi insiders against Hitler, including General Ludwig Beck and Lieutenant-Colonel Hans Oster, whose ceaseless activity in the German resistance may be unknown to many readers. This eminently readable narrative concentrates on the efforts of a group of conspirators within the German army who first began to plot against Hitler in the fall of 1938, and whose story culminates in the famous July 1944 bombing. Target Hitler is a work of historical significance. For as Duffy and Ricci remind us, it is important to know and remember that even in the most tyrranical states, with all the odds against them, there are men and women who are willing to risk all in order to oppose evil."," History , Military , General",Praeger,"Saturday, August 1, 1992",Price Starting at $5.29

Then another body is found, mutilated beyond recognition. Together, Isles and homicide detective Jane Rizzoli uncover an ancient horror that connects these terrible slaughters. As long-buried secrets come to light, Maura Isles finds herself drawn inexorably toward the heart of an investigation that strikes close to home–and toward a dawning revelation about the killer’s identity too shattering to consider."," Fiction , Thrillers , Suspense",Ballantine Books,"Sunday, August 1, 2004",Price Starting at $5.29

"Nude in Tub: Stories of Quillifarkeag, Maine","By Wuori, G. K.","Here is G.K. Wuori, out of nowhere and wielding a deadly weapon: his vision of our America...it's the raw. Wuori fiction is something entirely and wildly its own. Like Thomas Pynchon, Robert Coover, Mark Richard, Lewis Nordan, Wuori doesn't care to mollycoddle the reader. He's here, in this daring debut collection, to reflect what's on his mind: America's fascination with violence, with sex, with racism, with joyful immortality. Set in the northernmost corner of Maine, in a town ""usually omitted from cheap maps,"" Nude in Tub is about a young couple who make love on La-Z-Boys in the middle of a highway, about an old woman who finds a pine tree growing from her leg, about newlyweds who paint their whole house black and themselves white, and about several more stripped-down others, including, of course, a nude in tub. Descendants of Sherwood Anderson's Winesburgers, Wuori's Quillifarkeagans are Americans at the millenium, good citizens whose reality has been tweaked, twitted, quirked, smirked and found to be grimly goofy. These people - each of them caught in their own startling moment of nakedness - all live by the same credo: If you're in trouble, we'll help.

W. Bush, assigned to read the mail of the enlisted men under him, who says that in doing so he “learned about life”; and many other laudable Americans.

The Good German: A Novel,"By Kanon, Joseph","With World War II finally coming to an ending, Jake Geismar, former Berlin correspondent for CBS, has wangled one of the coveted press slots for the Potsdam Conference. His assignment: a series of articles on the Allied occupation. His personal agenda: to find Lena, the German mistress he left behind at the outbreak of the war. When he stumbles onto a murder - an American soldier has washed up on a lakeshore on the conference grounds - he thinks he has found the key that will unlock his Berlin story.What Jake finds instead is a larger story of corruption and intrigue reaching deep into the heart of the occupation. After twelve years of Nazi rule, six years of war, and months of brutal treatment by the Russians, Berlin has finally arrived at zero hour, a city not only physically but morally devastated. Children scavenge for food in the rubble, sex can be had for a cigarette, and heirlooms are traded for cans of PX rations. American GIs, flush with black market money, live in requisitioned villas and fraternize in underground jazz clubs; meanwhile, the air remains thick with mortar dust, and corpses still float in the canals. Berlin in July 1945 is like nowhere else - a tragedy, and a feverish party after the end of the world.And nothing is simple. As Jake searches the ruins for Lena, he discovers that years of war have led to unimaginable displacement and degradation. As he hunts for the soldier's killer, he learns that Berlin has become a city of secrets, a lunar landscape that seethes with social and political tension. When the two searches become entangled, Jake comes to understand that the American Military Government is already fighting a new enemy in the east, busily identifying the ""good Germans"" who can help with the next war.

Einstein: His Life and Universe,"By Isaacson, Walter","By the author of the acclaimed bestsellers Benjamin Franklin and Steve Jobs, this is the definitive biography of Albert Einstein. How did his mind work? What made him a genius? Isaacson’s biography shows how his scientific imagination sprang from the rebellious nature of his personality. His fascinating story is a testament to the connection between creativity and freedom.  Based on newly released personal letters of Einstein, this book explores how an imaginative, impertinent patent clerk—a struggling father in a difficult marriage who couldn’t get a teaching job or a doctorate—became the mind reader of the creator of the cosmos, the locksmith of the mysteries of the atom, and the universe. His success came from questioning conventional wisdom and marveling at mysteries that struck others as mundane. This led him to embrace a morality and politics based on respect for free minds, free spirits, and free individuals.  These traits are just as vital for this new century of globalization, in which our success will depend on our creativity, as they were for the beginning of the last century, when Einstein helped usher in the modern age."," Science , Physics , Relativity",Simon & Schuster,"Thursday, May 1, 2008",Price Starting at $8.79

These are the kinds of questions that David Macaulay asks himself when he observes an architectural wonder. These questions take him back to the basic process of design from which all structures begin, from the realization of a need for the structure to the struggles of the engineers and designers to map out and create the final construction.     As only he can, David Macaulay engages readers’ imaginations and gets them thinking about structures they see and use every day — bridges, tunnels, skyscrapers, domes, and dams. In Building Big he focuses on the connections between the planning and design problems and the solutions that are finally reached. Whether a structure is imposing or inspiring, he shows us that common sense and logic play just as important a part in architecture as imagination and technology do. As always, Macaulay inspires readers of all ages to look at their world in a new way."," Juvenile Nonfiction , Architecture",HMH Books for Young Readers,"Sunday, October 1, 2000",Price Starting at $8.79

There is a wedding address, a study of the not-so-random books that are used as props in mail-order catalogs, and a recipe. The final essay, which appears in print here for the first time, pursues through several centuries of prose and poetry the vagaries of the word lumber as a metaphor for the contents of the human mind, in what becomes in the telling a dazzlingly pedantic case study of the fanaticism of scholarship and the beauty that can reside within a piece of ordinary language."," Literary Collections , Essays",Random House,"Friday, March 1, 1996",Price Starting at $4.99

At Sea,"By Olson, Toby","When obsession threatens to consume a man, death can be a relief. Or it can be the beginning of an even more disturbing journeyIn At Sea, Toby Olson once again explores a darker side of love and relationship, this time through the difficulties of characters in a Cape Cod town, where lifestyles mix, and sexual jealousy provokes deadly passions. The result is a complex mystery involving family secrets, brutal assault and death.It is Peter Blue, an undercover narcotics agent in Provincetown, who finds himself at sea. Troubled in his marriage to Sara, drawn to the rape victim, Beth Charters, Peter is torn in his affections. When he takes part in a drug bust that results in the death of a local fisherman, Peter's motives become suspect. When many in the town turn against him, he is put on temporary suspension.Peter leaves Provincetown for safe haven, but when he returns he finds that everything he'd counted on has come apart. A brutal murder raises more questions, creates more doubts. Peter is rescued from a drunken binge by Charlie Glen, the piano player at a local bar; together they set out to unravel the mystery that has developed, one which goes well beyond the recent murder. Their investigations lead them into the past, the underlife of the town's gay bars, out into the dunes of the National Seashore, even to the sea itself. In the end it is as much their own lives that are understood as those of the criminals they've pursued.As in all of Olson's fiction, including the PEN/Faulkner Award-winning Seaview and his most recent Dorit in Lesbos, At Sea explores issues of memory, coercion and sexual ambivalence. But here setting too becomes character, the delicate structures of Provincetown's culture and the natural world that surrounds it serving as a backdrop for the fragile and complex emotions of Peter Blue and those whose lives he touches.At Sea is at once mystery and psychological novel, yet written with the same stylistic elegance, the same care for detail that has become Olson's hallmark. At Sea takes its place with Toby Olson's five previous novels, a body of work that is unique in contemporary American fiction."," Fiction , General",Simon & Schuster,"Saturday, May 1, 1993",Price Starting at $19.25

The Last Witchfinder: A Novel,"By Morrow, James","From a writer who has been lauded as ""an original -- stylistically ingenious, savagely funny, always unpre-dictable"" (Philadelphia Inquirer) and ""unerring"" (San Diego Union-Tribune), who has been compared to Mark Twain, Kurt Vonnegut, and John Updike, a writer whose pen has given us a devastating lampoon of the nuclear-arms race and an audacious answer to the outrageous question ""What if God had a daughter?"" -- from this writer, the critically acclaimed James Morrow, comes a novel of history, adventure, science, sex, satire, absurdity, and philosophy.Jennet Stearne's father hangs witches for a living in Restoration England. But when this precocious child witnesses the horrifying death of her beloved Aunt Isobel, unjustly executed as a sorceress, she makes it her life's mission to bring down the Parliamentary Witchcraft Act. A self-educated ""natural philosopher,"" Jennet is inspired in her quest by a single sentence in a cryptic letter from Isaac Newton: It so happens that in the Investigations leading first to my Conjectures concerning Light and later to my System of the World, I fell upon a pretty Proof that Wicked Spirits enjoy no essential Existence. Armed with nothing but the power of reason and her memory of Isobel's love, Jennet cannot rest until she has put the last witchfinder out of business.Abrim with picaresque adventures -- escapades that carry Jennet from King William's Britain to the fledgling American Colonies to an uncharted Caribbean island -- our heroine's search for justice entangles her variously in the machinations of the Salem Witch Court, the customs of her Algonquin Indian captors, the designs of a West Indies pirate band, and the bedsheets of her brilliant lover, the young Ben Franklin. Finally, in a reckless and courageous ploy, Jennet arranges to go on trial herself for sorcery, the only way she can defeat the witchfinders now and forever.

The Gospel According to the Son,"By Mailer, Norman","Now Norman Mailer has written a novel about Jesus' life. Is God speaking to me? Jesus asks. Or am I hearing voices? If the voices are from God, why has He chosen me as His son? And if they are not from God, then who gave me the power to perform these miracles?It soon becomes evident that we are being told the story of a skilled and most devout carpenter who is living with prodigious questions. The result, paradoxically, is an intimately readable account of a man thrust forward by the visions he receives, the sermons he offers, and the miracles he enacts until he comes to the apocalyptic end of his powers.The Gospel According to the Son, while adhering closely to the New Testament, also succeeds in vividly re-creating the world of Galilee and Jerusalem two thousand years ago. In a time of uneasy stability, the Holy Land is governed by a complacent but fearful establishment who rule over a despairing underclass - it is a time of great change, open to comparison with our own. Mailer's signal accomplishment is to create for us a man wholly unlike others who is nonetheless filled with passion and doubt, strength and weakness; a protagonist divine and human, a son of God who shares our condition."," Fiction , Literary",Random House,"Tuesday, April 1, 1997",Price Starting at $4.99

Innocent Traitor: A Novel of Lady Jane Grey,"By Weir, Alison","I am now a condemned traitor . . . I am to die when I have hardly begun to live.Historical expertise marries page-turning fiction in Alison Weir’s enthralling debut novel, breathing new life into one of the most significant and tumultuous periods of the English monarchy. It is the story of Lady Jane Grey–“the Nine Days’ Queen”–a fifteen-year-old girl who unwittingly finds herself at the center of the religious and civil unrest that nearly toppled the fabled House of Tudor during the sixteenth century.The child of a scheming father and a ruthless mother, for whom she is merely a pawn in a dynastic game with the highest stakes, Jane Grey was born during the harrowingly turbulent period between Anne Boleyn’s beheading and the demise of Jane’s infamous great-uncle, King Henry VIII. With the premature passing of Jane’s adolescent cousin, and Henry’s successor, King Edward VI, comes a struggle for supremacy fueled by political machinations and lethal religious fervor. Unabashedly honest and exceptionally intelligent, Jane possesses a sound strength of character beyond her years that equips her to weather the vicious storm. And though she has no ambitions to rule, preferring to immerse herself in books and religious studies, she is forced to accept the crown, and by so doing sets off a firestorm of intrigue, betrayal, and tragedy.Alison Weir uses her unmatched skills as a historian to enliven the many dynamic characters of this majestic drama. Along with Lady Jane Grey, Weir vividly renders her devious parents; her much-loved nanny; the benevolent Queen Katherine Parr; Jane’s ambitious cousins; the Catholic “Bloody” Mary, who will stop at nothing to seize the throne; and the protestant and future queen Elizabeth. Readers venture inside royal drawing rooms and bedchambers to witness the power-grabbing that swirls around Lady Jane Grey from the day of her birth to her unbearably poignant death. Innocent Traitor paints a complete and compelling portrait of this captivating young woman, a faithful servant of God whose short reign and brief life would make her a legend.“An impressive debut. Weir shows skill at plotting and maintaining tension, and she is clearly going to be a major player in the . . . historical fiction game.”–The Independent“Alison Weir is one of our greatest popular historians. In her first work of fiction . . . Weir manages her heroine’s voice brilliantly, respecting the past’s distance while conjuring a dignified and fiercely modern spirit.”–London Daily Mail"," Fiction , Thrillers , Historical",Ballantine Books,"Thursday, November 1, 2007",Price Starting at $5.29
Mary Magdalen: Myth and Metaphor,"By Haskins, Susan","Mary Magdalen has always been a predominant and fascinating figure for Christianity. But who was she really? The Gnostics hailed her as the companion of the Savior and the woman He loved most. Early Christian writers called her the Bride of Christ and the apostle to the apostles. But for centuries her most durable image has been that of a prostitute who repented and devoted her life to Jesus - an image that both shaped and to some extent reflected the Church's attitude toward women. Yet this figure does not appear in the New Testament.All that we know of the real Magdalen are the four facts noted in the Gospels: she was one of Christ's followers; she was present at His crucifixion; she was one of the earliest witnesses of His resurrection; and she was the first person to be charged with proclaiming the Christian message. But somewhere along the line she was confused with Mary, the sister of Lazarus, and with the woman taken in adultery whose life Jesus saved.Using evidence from early Christian writings, medieval sermons, devotional works, and the art and literature of nearly two thousand years, Susan Haskins shows how Mary Magdalen merged with other figures in the New Testament until she came to epitomize the condition of women in the Church and in society. Today, when women are assuming more active roles in both, Mary Magdalen is once again being reevaluated."," Religion , General",Harcourt,"Tuesday, March 1, 1994",Price Starting at $10.99

This simple act is at the heart of The Bright Forever, a   deeply affecting novel about the choices people make that change their lives forever.

A nuanced portrayal   of the complicated give and take among people struggling to maintain their humanity   in the shadow of a loss, The Bright Forever is a compelling and emotional tale about the human need to know even the hardest   truth."," Fiction , Literary",Crown,"Saturday, April 1, 2006",Price Starting at $5.29
The Mother Dance: How Children Change Your Life,"By Lerner, Harriet Goldhor","From the celebrated author of The Dance of Anger comes an extraordinary book about mothering and how it transforms us -- and all our relationships -- inside and out.Writing from her dual perspective as psychologist and mother, Dr. Harriet Lerner puts the spotlight on how a woman is changed when she becomes a mother. Enlivened with personal tales and vivid case examples that run the gamut from hilarious to the heart-wrenching, The Mother Dance  spells out what happens to a woman when two become three... and four. We see why her new life is so different from his  -- and how children inevitably help us to discover things about ourselves and our partners that we would otherwise not know. Lerner shows us how kids call on us to grow up and are the best teachers of life&#39;s most profound spiritual lessons.From birth to the empty nest, Lerner&#39;s own experience has taught her the basic lessons of motherhood: that we are not in control of what happens to our children; that most of what we worry about doesn&#39;t happen (though bad things happen that we fail to anticipate); and that our children will love us with all our imperfections if we can do the same for them.Lerner helps us to distinguish what we can change (and how to do it), and when we need to surrender to the fact that our lives -- and our children&#39;s -- may not go as we expect or plan. With the insight, warmth and clarity that characterize all of Lerner&#39;s work, here is a gloriously witty and moving book about what it means to dance the mother dance."," Family & Relationships , Parenting , Motherhood",Harper,"Wednesday, April 1, 1998",Price Starting at $5.29

"The Presidency and Domestic Policy: Comparing Leadership Styles, FDR to Clinton","By Genovese, Michael A. and Lammers, William W.","Each president brings to the White House a distinct set of personal characteristics and a preferred leadership style, but just how much have individual presidents shaped domestic policy? To understand and assess what factors determine one president's success and another's limited accomplishments, it is important to examine both the individual's leadership roles and the circumstances which shape their opportunities for success. This new book systematically examines the first terms of every president from Franklin Delano Roosevelt to William Jefferson Clinton and assesses the leadership style, the policy agenda, and the ""political opportunity"" of each. Each president's success in effecting landmark legislation and other policy change is measured and evaluated.William W. Lammers and Michael A. Genovese look at how different levels of opportunity affect leadership and how each president played the political hands he was dealt. By dividing presidents along opportunity lines, Lammers and Genovese assess how skillful each president was in the art of presidential leadership, what strategies and tactics they employed to achieve their goals, and the policy legacies left by each."," Political Science , Political Process , General",CQ Press,"Saturday, January 1, 2000",Price Starting at $5.31

Existentialism For and Against,"By Roubiczek, Paul","Neither science nor a philosophy which aims at an entirely objective approach can deal with our personal experience. Value-judgements, for instance, presuppose freedom of choice and if responsible actions are to be based on them, man must be free to act according to his decisions. There is clearly an urgent need for a philosophy which can be lived; and it is as a philosophy of this kind that Existentialism exists. In this book Roubiczek confronts the prevalent 'objective' method with the 'subjective' and attempts a proper balance between the objective and the personal, the scientific and the ethical. Concentrating on the valuable aspects of Existentialism, he looks for positive results which can be philosophically justified and, at the same time, accepted as a way of life. This approach leads both towards and beyond Existentialism, so that the book is both an introduction to this school of philosophy and a critique of it."," Philosophy , General",Cambridge University Press,"Wednesday, January 1, 1964",Price Starting at $4.99

Greenie Duquette, openhearted yet stubborn, devotes most of her passionate attention to her Greenwich Village bakery and her four–year–old son, George. Her husband, Alan, seems to have fallen into a midlife depression, while Walter, a traditional gay man who has become her closest professional ally, is nursing a broken heart.It is at Walter’s restaurant that the visiting governor of New Mexico tastes Greenie’s coconut cake and decides to woo her away from the city to be his chef. For reasons both ambitious and desperate, she accepts—and finds herself heading west without her husband. This impulsive decision will change the course of several lives within and beyond Greenie’s orbit. Alan, alone in New York, must face down his demons; Walter, eager for platonic distraction, takes in his teenage nephew. Yet Walter cannot steer clear of love trouble, and despite his enforced solitude, Alan is still surrounded by women: his powerful sister, an old flame, and an animal lover named Saga, who grapples with demons all her own. As for Greenie, living in the shadow of a charismatic politician leads to a series of unforeseen consequences that separate her from her only child. We watch as folly, chance, and determination pull all these lives together and apart over a year that culminates in the fall of the twin towers at the World Trade Center, an event that will affirm or confound the choices each character has made—or has refused to face.Julia Glass is at her best here, weaving a glorious tapestry of lives and lifetimes, of places and people, revealing the subtle mechanisms behind our most important, and often most fragile, connections to others.

The Roaring Nineties: A New History of the World's Most Prosperous Decade,"By Stiglitz, Joseph E.","How one of the greatest economic expansions in history sowed the seeds of its own collapse. With his best-selling Globalization and Its Discontents, Joseph E. Stiglitz showed how a misplaced faith in free-market ideology led to many of the recent problems suffered by the developing nations. Here he turns the same light on the United States. This groundbreaking work by the Nobel Prize-winning economist argues that much of what we understood about the 1990s' prosperity is wrong, that the theories that have been used to guide world leaders and anchor key business decisions were fundamentally outdated. Yes, jobs were created, technology prospered, inflation fell, and poverty was reduced. But at the same time the foundation was laid for the economic problems we face today. Trapped in a near-ideological commitment to free markets, policymakers permitted accounting standards to slip, carried deregulation further than they should have, and pandered to corporate greed. These chickens have now come home to roost."," Business & Economics , Economics , General",W W Norton & Co Inc,"Monday, September 1, 2003",Price Starting at $5.69

With two grown children and a lovely home in Connecticut, Paris was happy with her marriage, her family, her life. So when her husband of twenty-four years said they needed to talk, Paris couldn’t imagine what he was about to say.“I want a divorce,” Peter tells her. Just like that, the husband she adored had dumped her for a younger woman. And just like that, Peter and his thirty-one-year-old lover had made their plans for their future, leaving Paris to pick up the pieces of a shattered life. Within days, Peter was gone. And Paris was left to figure out how she intended to get through the next day, let alone the rest of her life.The task could not have been more painful.  First came the tears. Then the excruciating attempts by well-meaning friends to “fix her up” with men who paled in comparison to Peter.  Worse yet, she still loved him.  Finally, Paris realized she was in a fight for her very survival. Drastic measures were called for. Even her shrink agreed. It was time to move—as far away as possible, just after Peter remarried.  Paris had never felt, or been, more alone.Saying good-bye to the world she knew and loved, Paris heads west, to San Francisco, and discovers being single in a world full of men who were too young, too old, too married, or too good to be true. For Paris, the list seemed endless...the charming commitment-phobe...the drunken Neanderthal...the young Frenchman—so adorably sexy she almost forgot about his age, and did, for a while. With her dating track record veering between disappointing and disastrous, and her daughter now engaged to a man Paris’s age, Paris finally comes to the conclusion that romance is not in her future. That’s when her small circle of offbeat, loving friends becomes more important than ever before. And a decision Paris makes only for herself changes her life once more.

"HP Way, The","By Packard, David, Kirby, David (EDT), and Lewis, Karen R. (EDT)","From a one-car-garage company to a multibillion-dollar industry, the rise of Hewlett-Packard is an extraordinary tale of vision, innovation and hard work. Conceived in 1939, Hewlett-Packard earned success not only as a result of its engineering know-how and cutting-edge product ideas, but also because of the unique management style it developed -- a way of doing things called ""the HP way"".   Decades before today's creative management trends, Hewlett-Packard invented such strategies as ""walk-around management"", ""flextime"", and ""quality cycles"". Always sensitive to the needs of its customers and responsive to employee input, Hewlett-Packard earned massive steady growth that far outshone its competitors' vacillating fortunes, even with radically different products from those responsible for its initial boom.   For entrepreneurs and managers alike, the wisdom found in these pages is invaluable if they want their businesses to gain steady growth and consistent success. Transcending the ever-shifting marketplace and management trends, The HP Way offers the hard-won and battle-tested practical experience of a proven and respected leader."," Business & Economics , Industries , General",HarperPb,"Monday, April 1, 1996",Price Starting at $5.29

Brought in to solve the murder of New York's best-known real estate tycoon, Wolf soon finds himself caught in a frightening spiral of betrayal, lust, and greed, a hall of mirrors where nothing is what it seems and no one can be trusted.Wolf, son of a Wind River Shoshone and a Texas Ranger, soon discovers that murder is the least of the crimes that have been committed: treason, espionage, even, almost unthinkably, the quest for immortality, are all a prelude to an imminent global war.In a whole new arena - larger and more terrifying than any he has been in before - Wolf finds he must battle people possessed of a mind power so lethal it has remained hidden for centuries. To do this he will have to unlock the riddle of his own past; a past he has disowned.

And before their search is over forces they can only guess at will be unleashed to wreak murder, mayhem, and madness on all who join it.Black Blade is bullet-fast reading, a brilliant excursion into adventure and romance, intrigue and sex, providing a feast of insights into the mysteries of the Oriental mind."," Fiction , Thrillers , General",Fawcett,"Friday, January 1, 1993",Price Starting at $10.99

But when he opens an innocuous-looking letter addressed to him at The Source, he discovers that someone else excels at ferreting out secrets as well.Ten-year-old Charlotte Bowen has been abducted, and if Luxford does not admit publicly to having fathered her, she will die.  But Charlotte's existence is Luxford's most fiercely guarded secret, and acknowledging her as his child will throw more than one life and career into chaos.  Luxford knows that the story of Charlotte's paternity could make him a laughingstock and reveal to his beautiful wife and son the lie he's lived for a decade.  Yet it's not only Luxford's reputation that's on the line: it's also the reputation—and career—of Charlotte Bowen's mother.  For she is Undersecretary of State for the Home Office, one of the most high-profile Junior Ministers and quite possibly the next Margaret Thatcher.Knowing that her political future hangs in the balance, Eve Bowen refuses to let Luxford damage her career by printing the story or calling the police.  So the editor turns to forensic scientist Simon St. James for help.  It's a case that fills St. James with disquiet, however, for none of the players in the drama seem to react the way one would expect.Then tragedy occurs and New Scotland Yard becomes involved.

Looking for Alaska,"By Jenkins, Peter","More than twenty years ago, a disillusioned college graduate named Peter Jenkins set out with his dog Cooper to look for himself and his nation.  His memoir of what he found, A Walk Across America, captured the hearts of millions of Americans.Now, Peter is a bit older, married with a family, and his journeys are different than they were. Perhaps he is looking for adventure, perhaps inspiration, perhaps new communities, perhaps unspoiled land.  Certainly, he found all of this and more in Alaska, America's last wilderness.Looking for Alaska is Peter's account of eighteen months spent traveling over twenty thousand miles in tiny bush planes, on snow machines and snowshoes, in fishing boats and kayaks, on the Alaska Marine Highway and the Haul Road, searching for what defines Alaska. Hearing the amazing stories of many real Alaskans--from Barrow to Craig, Seward to Deering, and everywhere in between--Peter gets to know this place in the way that only he can. His resulting portrait is a rare and unforgettable depiction of a dangerous and beautiful land and all the people that call it home.  He also took his wife and eight-year-old daughter with him, settling into a ""home base"" in Seward on the Kenai Peninsula, coming and going from there, and hosting the rest of their family for extended visits. The way his family lived, how they made Alaska their home and even participated in Peter's explorations, is as much a part of this story as Peter's own travels.All in all, Jenkins delivers a warm, funny, awe-inspiring, and memorable diary of discovery-both of this place that captures all of our imaginations, and of himself, all over again."," Travel , United States , West , Pacific (AK, CA, HI, OR, WA)",St. Martin's Griffin,"Sunday, September 1, 2002",Price Starting at $4.99

American Empire: Blood & Iron,"By Turtledove, Harry","“Blood and Iron is a masterpiece.”—Sci Fi Weekly World War I—The Great War—has ended, and an uneasy peace reigns around the world. Nowhere is it more fragile than on the continent of North America, where bitter enemies share a single landmass and two long, bloody borders. In the North, proud Canadian nationalists try to resist the colonial power of the United States. In the South, the once-mighty Confederate States have been pounded into poverty and merciless inflation. The time is right for madmen, demagogues, and terrorists. With Socialists rising to power in the U.S., and a dangerous fanatic in the Confederacy preaching a doctrine of hate, more than enough people are eager to return the world to war. “A master storyteller as well as a trained historian with an imagination . . . [Turtledove] has succeeded in taking title as the premier writer in [alternate history], relentlessly asking what if one or two key events in our reality happened differently. The result is fascinating.”—Houston Chronicle “Turtledove is a master at weaving details of ordinary life into a much bigger canvas to produce a world that so easily could have been our own.

We'd just toss out our birth control pills and before we knew it, we'd be rocking our little one to sleep.

The Big Show: High Times and Dirty Dealings Backstage at the Academy Awards,"By Pond, Steve, Streiber, Art (PHT), Regan, Lara Jo (PHT), and Striek, David (PHT)","An unprecedented look at the machinations behind everyone's favorite Hollywood circus and what it reveals about the business of moviemaking.Oscar parties. Oscar pools. Oscar style. Oscar predictions. The Oscars breed their own peculiar mania and a billion people worldwide are alleged to watch the broadcast every year. While that figure may be the Academy's big white lie, the Oscars draw a viewership well into the hundreds of millions--a tremendous audience for what is essentially a television program. But this is no ordinary show. Love it or loathe it, the Oscars are an irresistible spectacle: a gloriously gaudy, glitzy, momentous, and foolish window into the unholy alliance of art and commerce that is the film industry. The Oscar statuette is a totem of such potency that millions are spent and careers laid on the line in the reckless pursuit of an eight-pound chunk of gold-plated britannium.   The Big Show is a chronicle of the past fifteen years of the Academy Awards, the most tumultuous decade in Oscar's seventy-six year history. Written by the only journalist ever given carte blanche access to the planning, production, and backstage intrigue of the Oscars, it offers an unguarded, behind-the-scenes glimpse of this singular event, along with remarkable insight into how the Oscars reflect the high-stakes politics of Hollywood, our obsession with celebrities (not to mention celebrities' obsession with themselves), and the cinematic state of the union."," Performing Arts , Film & Video , History & Criticism",Faber & Faber,"Saturday, January 1, 2005",Price Starting at $5.80

The English American: A Novel,"By Larkin, Alison","When Pippa Dunn,adopted as an infant and raised terribly British, discovers that her birth parents are from the American South, she finds that ""culture clash"" has layers of meaning she'd never imagined. Meet The English American, a fabulously funny, deeply poignant debut novel that sprang from Larkin's autobiographical one-woman show of the same name.In many ways, Pippa Dunn is very English: she eats Marmite on toast, knows how to make a proper cup of tea, has attended a posh English boarding school, and finds it entirely familiar to discuss the crossword rather than exchange any cross words over dinner with her proper English family. Yet Pippa -- creative, disheveled, and impulsive to the core -- has always felt different from her perfectly poised, smartly coiffed sister and steady, practical parents, whose pastimes include Scottish dancing, gardening, and watching cricket.When Pippa learns at age twenty-eight that her birth parents are from the American South, she feels that lifelong questions have been answered. She meets her birth mother, an untidy, artistic, free-spirited redhead, and her birth father, a charismatic (and politically involved) businessman in Washington, D.C.; and she moves to America to be near them. At the same time, she relies on the guidance of a young man with whom she feels a mysterious connection; a man who discovered his own estranged father and who, like her birth parents, seems to understand her in a way that no one in her life has done before. Pippa feels she has found her ""self"" and everything she thought she wanted. But has she?Caught between two opposing cultures, two sets of parents, and two completely different men, Pippa is plunged into hilarious, heart-wrenching chaos. The birth father she adores turns out to be involved in neoconservative activities she hates; the mesmerizing mother who once abandoned her now refuses to let her go. And the man of her fantasies may be just that...With an authentic adopted heroine at its center, Larkin's compulsively readable first novel unearths universal truths about love, identity, and family with wit, warmth, and heart."," Fiction , Literary",Simon & Schuster,"Saturday, March 1, 2008",Price Starting at $5.25

At once, she feels the heavy hand of Alice Beaumont, pushing for the indictment and speedy trial of Billy Fletcher, who is Morgan's brother and her factory manager.

The Gifts of the Jews: How a Tribe of Desert Nomads Changed the Way Everyone Thinks and Feels (The Hinges of History),"By Cahill, Thomas","We normally think of history as one catastrophe after another, war followed by war, outrage by outrage--almost as if history were nothing more than all the narratives of human pain, assembled in sequence. And surely this is, often enough, an adequate description. But history is also the narratives of grace, the recountings of those blessed and inexplicable moments when someone did something for someone else, saved a life, bestowed a gift, gave something beyond what was required by circumstance. In this series, The Hinges of History, I mean to retell the story of the Western world as the story of the great gift-givers, those who entrusted to our keeping one or another of the singular treasures that make up the patrimony of the West. This is also the story of the evolution of Western sensibility, a narration of how we became the people that we are and why we think and feel the way we do. And it is, finally, a recounting of those essential moments when everything was at stake, when the mighty stream that became Western history was in ultimate danger and might have divided into a hundred useless tributaries or frozen in death or evaporated altogether. But the great gift-givers, arriving in the moment of crisis, provided for transition, for transformation, and even for transfiguration, leaving us a world more varied and complex, more awesome and delightful, more beautiful and strong than the one they had found. --Thomas Cahill"," Religion , Judaism , History",Anchor Books/Nan A Talese,"Sunday, August 1, 1999",Price Starting at $5.29

Stirring of Soul in the Workplace,"By Briskin, Alan","This deeply lyrical book offers perspective for those struggling to hear the quiet voice of the soul over the din of the contemporary workplace. Alan Briskin shows how the modern organization has gradually increased its demands on us-beginning with our bodies, then our minds, and now our souls. But through the moving personal stories of people fighting to reclaim their souls, he also sends a message that encourages individuals to keep their spiritual integrity and values alive. In The Stirring of Soul In the Workplace, Briskin weaves together lessons from history, psychology, and management theory, with numerous real-life examples, to tell the story of how the modern workplace has evolved to value technology and productivity over soulfulness and relationship. From the Industrial Revolution&apos;s marriage of mechanization and efficiency to the management theories of the early 20th century, Briskin traces the emergence of the quest for efficiency and control in the workplace. He questions the corporate concept of ""individual personality"" that asks us to check our emotions, fantasies, imaginations, and souls at the door. He describes the history of the soul as a dynamic force that continues to influence our behavior, and shows how excluding it from our work life actually flattens our potential and dampens our creativity. Rather than solve the conventional question organizations have been asking for years-how can we change people?-Alan Briskin examines how organizations can better reflect personal and human values in the workplace. For organizations that too often have sacrificed the well-being of the individual for the goals of the organization, the author suggests a more active way of taking up our work roles that can bring more of our experience and imagination into play. He points out that meaning cannot come from corporate mission statements or reengineering programs. Instead, it needs to be nurtured through dialogue and reflection, the courage to ask troubling questions, and a willingness to face the consequences of our collective and individual actions. When we learn to honor the contradictions, uncertainties, and interconnections inherent in the workplace, the energies of the soul will begin to stir with revitalizing results."," Business & Economics , Motivational",Berrett-Koehler Publishers,"Sunday, March 1, 1998",Price Starting at $5.29

Beyond Belief: Finding the Strength to Come Back,"By Hamilton, Josh and Keown, Tim","Josh Hamilton was the first player chosen in the first round of the 1999 baseball draft. He was destined to be one of those rare ""high-character "" superstars.  But in 2001, working his way from the minors to the majors, all of the plans for Josh went off the rails in a moment of weakness.

"The Audacity of Greed: Free Markets, Corporate Thieves, and the Looting of America","By Tasini, Jonathan","""Jonathan Tasini is one of the country's premier labor writers. Not just a reporter, he brings a wealth of firsthand, frontline, experience to every issue he tackles.""—Barbara Ehrenreich""This is must reading for anyone who wants to know how we got us into this financial mess—and what it will take to get out of it.""—Katrina vanden Heuvel""In order to comprehend the entirety of our nation’s economic system, an understanding of working-class Americans and the labor movement is absolutely essential. Nobody understands that better than Jonathan Tasini. His writing is infused with a thorough knowledge of not only labor, but how corporate greed is at the root of the recent economic collapse.”—James P. Hoffa, General President, International Brotherhood of Teamsters""Jonathan Tasini dares to utter the words that are still not said in ""polite"" company: The G-word: Greed! The T-word: Theft! No, greed is not good. Enriching oneself by taking the money of others and leaving them poor: that's theft. Tasini shows us the economy as we need to see it-from the perspective of people who work.""—George Lakoff,author of The Political Mind and Don't Think of an Elephant!Over the past quarter century, we have lived through the greatest looting of wealth in human history. While billions of dollars streamed into the pockets of a few elites in the corporate and economic class, the vast majority of citizens have lived through a period of falling wages, disappearing pensions, and dwindling bank accounts—all of which lead to the personal debt crisis that lies at the root of the current financial meltdown. This ""audacity of greed"" was legally blessed by the ethos of the ""free market,"" a phony marketing phrase that covered up the fleecing of the American public.In The Audacity of Greed, Jonathan Tasini examines the reasons and exposes the people responsible for the looting of America—from Wall Street executives who funded their lavish lifestyles at the public's expense to the politicians who let it happen—arguing that we need a cultural and philosophical revolution that punctures the fable of market fundamentalism and, by doing so, values the contributions made by ordinary Americans throughout the economy.Jonathan Tasini is executive director of the Labor Research Association. The longtime president of the National Writers Union, he was the lead plaintiff in Tasini vs. The New York Times, the landmark electronic rights case that took on the corporate media's assault on the rights of freelance authors. In 2006 he ran against Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination for the US Senate in New York. He has written about labor and economics for a variety of publications including The New York Times Magazine, The Washington Post,  Los Angeles Times, and The Wall Street Journal, and has appeared on CNBC and Fox News."," Business & Economics , Business Ethics",Ig Publishing,"Tuesday, September 1, 2009",Price Starting at $5.29

Brilliant, charismatic, and wholly unpredictable,  Blake Williams made millions and grabbed headlines as a dot-com entrepreneur.

Then everything changes….  For Maxine it starts when she  falls in love with Dr. Charles West, a man who is everything Blake is not—mature,  grounded, and present.

Now Blake wants Maxine in his life again—as a partner in a humanitarian  project that could change countless lives. For Maxine the choice is clear. But Blake’ s sudden transformation—from carefree playboy to compassionate, responsible grown-up—raises  questions she’s never managed to answer . . . and some she’s afraid to ask.

The Humanist Alternative,"By Kurtz, Paul W.","The contributors to this volume were asked the following questions:The term ""Humanism"" is widely used, as are the terms ""ethical"" Humanism, ""scientific"" Humanism and ""religious"" Humanism. What is Humanism? Can you define it?If there is in your judgment no clear definition in the literature, you may wish to propose one. You may also wish to focus on the relationship of Humanism to atheism, science, its ethical position, or some other theme.Those who have contributed represent a wide spectrum of Humanist opinion in the world today. They are primarily philosophers, psychologists, social scientists, ethical and religious leaders. Among the themes they discuss are historic roots of Humanism, the general problem of definition, the relationship of Humanism to ethics and morality, Humanism and religion, Humanism and atheism and Humanism on the world scene. Most of the varieties of Humanism are represented, including naturalistic Humanism, liberal Humanism, atheistic Humanism, humanistic psychology, behaviourism, Marxism, and Zen.If there is a common thread running throughout this volume, it is the conviction that Humanism is committed to the method of reason as the chief means of solving problems and the belief that mankind can survive and humans can enjoy a significant life. This conviction and this belief, however, can be realized only if men continue to have confidence in their own natural powers and abilities and the courage to use them."," Philosophy , Movements , Humanism",Prometheus,"Tuesday, May 1, 1973",Price Starting at $5.29

Winning the Future: A 21st Century Contract With America,"By Gingrich, Newt","According to former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, America currently faces five threats that could undermine, if not eliminate, the United States if immediate steps are not taken to correct them. The threats as he sees them are Islamic terrorists and rogue dictatorships armed with nuclear or biological weapons; the removal of God from American public life; a loss of patriotism and sense of America's history; a decline in economic supremacy because of poor science and math education; and the increasing budgetary burden of Social Security and Medicare. To tackle these problems, Gingrich offers his ""21st Century Contract with America,"" which he outlines in great detail in this bold and thought-provoking book. His updated contract, which comes a decade after the original Republican Contract with America that marked the high point of Gingrich's national power, calls for a dramatically simplified tax code that favors savings and investment; government investment in science and technology, particularly regarding space, energy, and the environment; transforming Social Security into personal savings accounts; overhauling the civil justice system to reduce the burden of lawsuits; and updating the federal government, including the privatization of some functions, so that it moves at the speed and effectiveness of the information age. And that's just the beginning. He also calls for tripling the size of America's intelligence community, reforming its election system, developing a more intelligent health care system that creates jobs and increases quality of life, and balancing the federal budget.Gingrich believes that this ambitious agenda can be accomplished, but only if it receives grassroots support. The entrenched political system, with its lobbyists, bloated bureaucracies, and the complicity of the media, is too self-serving to fix itself, he stresses. Concise and clearly presented, Winning the Future is long on specifics and short on rhetoric, and it succeeds as a springboard for political discourse. Gingrich's aim is clearly to inspire citizens to take responsibility for the county's direction by demanding more of their government and their leaders."," Political Science , Public Policy , Economic Policy",Regnery Publishing,"Monday, May 1, 2006",Price Starting at $5.29

A New Way to Cook,"By Schneider, Sally and Robledo, Maria (PHT)","Sally Schneider was tired of doing what we all do—separating foods into ""good"" and ""bad,"" into those we crave but can't have and those we can eat freely but don't especially want—so she created A New Way To Cook.Her book is nothing short of revolutionary, a redefinition of healthy eating, where no food is taboo, where the pleasure principle is essential to well-being, where the concept of self-denial just doesn't exist.More than 600 lavishly illustrated recipes result in marvelous, vividly flavored foods. You'll find quintessential American favorites that taste every bit as good as the traditional ""full-tilt"" versions: macaroni and cheese, rosemary buttermilk biscuits, chocolate malted pudding. You'll find Italian polentas, risottos, focaccias, and pastas, all reinvented without the loss of a single drop of deliciousness. Asian flavors shine through in cold sesame noodles; mussels with lemongrass, ginger, and chiles; and curry-crusted shrimp. Even French food is no longer on the forbidden list, with country-style pâtés and cassoulet.Hundreds of techniques, radical in their ultimate simplicty, make all the difference in the world: using chestnut puree in place of cream, butter, and pork fat in a duck liver mousse; extending the richness of flavored oils by boiling them with a little broth to dress starchy beans and grains; casserole-roasting baby back ribs to render them of fat, then lacquering them with a pungent maple glaze.Scores of flavor catalysts—quickly made sauces, rubs, marinades, essences, and vinaigrettes—add instant hits of flavor with little effort. Leek broth dresses pasta; chive oil becomes an instant sauce for broiled salmon; a smoky tea essence imparts a sweet, grilled flavor to steak; balsamic vinegar turns into a luscious dessert sauce. Variations and improvisations offer infiinite flexibility. Once you learn a basic recipe, it's simple to devise your own version for any part of the meal. ""Fried"" artichockes with crispy garlic and sage can be an hors d-oeuvre topped with shaved cheeses, part of a composed salad, or as a main course when tossed iwth pasta. It's equally happy on top of pizza or stirred into risotto. And by building dishes from simple elements, turning out complex meals doesn't have to be a complex affair.A wealth of tips and practical information to make you a more accomplished and self-confident cook: how to rescue ordinary olive oil to give it more flavor, how to make soups creamy without cream, how to freshen less-than-perfect fish.So here it is, 756 glorious pages of all the deliciousness and joy that food is meant to convey."," Cooking , Health & Healing , General",Artisan,"Wednesday, October 1, 2003",Price Starting at $7.56

Summer for the Gods: The Scopes Trial and America's Continuing Debate over Science and Religion,"By Larson, Edward J.","With this authoritative and engaging book, Edward J. Larson examines the many facets of the Scopes trial and shows how its enduring legacy has crossed religious, cultural, educational, and political lines.The ""Monkey Trial,"" as it was playfully nicknamed, was instigated by the American Civil Liberties Union to challenge a controversial Tennessee law banning the teaching of human evolution in public schools. The Tennessee statute represented the first major victory for an intense national campaign against Darwinism, launched in the 1920s by Protestant fundamentalists and led by the famed politician and orator William Jennings Bryan. At the behest of the ACLU, a teacher named John Scopes agreed to challenge the statute, and what resulted was a trial of mythic proportions. Bryan joined the prosecutors and acclaimed criminal attorney Clarence Darrow led the defense - a dramatic legal matchup that spurred enormous media attention and later inspired the classic play Inherit the Wind.The Scopes trial marked a watershed in our national discussion of science and religion. In addition to symbolizing the clash between evolutionists and creationists, the trial helped shape the development of both popular religion and constitutional law in America, serving as a precedent for more recent legal and political battles."," Social Science , Anthropology , General",Harvard University Press,"Sunday, November 1, 1998",Price Starting at $5.29

Pelton soon embarked on a globe-spanning odyssey to penetrate and understand this shadowy world, ultimately delivering stunning insights into the way private soldiers are used.Enter a blood-soaked world of South African mercenaries and tribal fighters backed by ruthless financiers. Drop into Baghdad’s Green Zone, strap on body armor, and take a daily high-speed ride with a doomed crew of security contractors who dodge car bombs and snipers just to get their charges to the airport. Share a drink in a chic hotel bar with wealthy owners of private armies who debate the best way to stay alive in war zones.Licensed to Kill spans four continents and three years, taking us inside the CIA’s dirty wars; the brutal contractor murders in Fallujah and the Alamo-like sieges in Najaf and Al Kut; the Deep South contractor training camps where ex–Special Operations soldiers and even small town cops learn the ropes; the contractor conventions where macho attendees swap bullet-punctuated tales and discuss upcoming gigs; and the grim Central African prison where contractors turned failed mercenaries pay a steep price.The United States has encouraged the use of the private sector in all facets of the War on Terror, placing contractors outside the bounds of functional legal constraints. With the shocking clarity that can come only from firsthand observation, Licensed to Kill painstakingly deconstructs the most controversial events and introduces the pivotal players. Most disturbingly, it shows that there are indeed thousands of contractors—with hundreds more being produced every month—who’ve been given a license to kill, their services available to the highest bidder."," History , Military , General",Crown,"Tuesday, August 1, 2006",Price Starting at $5.41
Villages: A Novel,"By Updike, John","In this wry novel of sentimental education and sexual pursuit, we follow Owen Mackenzie, a representative man of the author’s generation, from cradle to grave, and from bed to bed. His life and relationships are shaped by three villages, warm-lit communities that keep the darkness at bay from within and without. In Willow, Pennsylvania, the young Owen is transfixed by his first glimpses of female beauty. In Middle Falls, Connecticut, he marries, becomes a first-wave computer programmer, and discovers the very grownup pleasures of serial adultery. Finally, married for a second time, he retires with his memories, illusions, and fantasies to the somewhat geriatric community of Haskells Crossing, Massachusetts. John Updike turns Owen’s personal odyssey into a radiant, sensual fable of the seasons of a man’s life—and of the getting of wisdom in America."," Fiction , Short Stories (single author)",Random House Trade Paperbacks,"Thursday, September 1, 2005",Price Starting at $5.29

Peony in Love: A Novel,"By See, Lisa","“I finally understand what the poets have written. In spring, moved to passion; in autumn only regret.”For young Peony, betrothed to a suitor she has never met, these lyrics from The Peony Pavilion mirror her own longings. In the garden of the Chen Family Villa, amid the scent of ginger, green tea, and jasmine, a small theatrical troupe is performing scenes from this epic opera, a live spectacle few females have ever seen. Like the heroine in the drama, Peony is the cloistered daughter of a wealthy family, trapped like a good-luck cricket in a bamboo-and-lacquer cage. Though raised to be obedient, Peony has dreams of her own.Peony’s mother is against her daughter’s attending the production: “Unmarried girls should not be seen in public.” But Peony’s father assures his wife that proprieties will be maintained, and that the women will watch the opera from behind a screen. Yet through its cracks, Peony catches sight of an elegant, handsome man with hair as black as a cave–and is immediately overcome with emotion.So begins Peony’s unforgettable journey of love and destiny, desire and sorrow–as Lisa See’s haunting new novel, based on actual historical events, takes readers back to seventeenth-century China, after the Manchus seize power and the Ming dynasty is crushed. Steeped in traditions and ritual, this story brings to life another time and place–even the intricate realm of the afterworld, with its protocols, pathways, and stages of existence, a vividly imagined place where one’s soul is divided into three, ancestors offer guidance, misdeeds are punished, and hungry ghosts wander the earth. Immersed in the richness and magic of the Chinese vision of the afterlife, transcending even death, Peony in Love explores, beautifully, the many manifestations of love. Ultimately, Lisa See’s new novel addresses universal themes: the bonds of friendship, the power of words, and the age-old desire of women to be heard."," Fiction , Historical , General",Random House Trade Paperbacks,"Friday, February 1, 2008",Price Starting at $4.99

If he hadn’t poured a glass of water down the throat of a tuba, maybe he wouldn’t have been sent to a health resort in Badenweiler, Germany.

Soldier's Heart: Reading Literature Through Peace and War at West Point,"By Samet, Elizabeth D.","Elizabeth D. Samet and her students learned to romanticize the army “from the stories of their fathers and from the movies.” For Samet, it was the old World War II movies she used to watch on TV, while her students grew up onBraveheart and Saving Private Ryan. Unlike their teacher, however, these students, cadets at the United States Military Academy at West Point, have decided to turn make-believe into real life. West Point is a world away from Yale, where Samet attended graduate school and where nothing sufficiently prepared her for teaching literature to young men and women who were training to fight a war. Intimate and poignant,Soldier’s Heart chronicles the various tensions inherent in that life as well as the ways in which war has transformed Samet’s relationship to literature. Fighting in Iraq, Samet’s former students share what books and movies mean to them—the poetry of Wallace Stevens, the fiction of Virginia Woolf and J. M. Coetzee, the epics of Homer, or the films of James Cagney. Their letters in turn prompt Samet to wonder exactly what she owes to cadets in the classroom. Samet arrived at West Point before September 11, 2001, and has seen the academy change dramatically. InSoldier’s Heart, she reads this transformation through her own experiences and those of her students. Forcefully examining what it means to be a civilian teaching literature at a military academy, Samet also considers the role of women in the army, the dangerous tides of religious and political zeal roiling the country, the uses of the call to patriotism, and the cult of sacrifice she believes is currently paralyzing national debate. Ultimately, Samet offers an honest and original reflection on the relationship between art and life."," Language Arts & Disciplines , Study & Teaching","Farrar, Straus and Giroux","Monday, October 1, 2007",Price Starting at $5.29

Behind Palace Doors,"By Dempster, Nigel and Evans, Peter","For three decades, Nigel Dempster, London's top gossip columnist, has chronicled Britain's royal family and been the confidant of several of its members. While others have speculated about the royals' loves and liaisons, their marriages, divorces, and remarriages, Dempster has heard the truth from some of the most highly placed sources in Britain. In Behind Palace Doors, he and investigative journalist Peter Evans present a through-the-keyhole story of the marital woes of the Windsors and their most celebrated members, Prince Charles and Princess Diana.Behind Palace Doors is an astonishing anatomy of what went wrong and where it will end. The union of Charles and Diana, the authors reveal, was doomed from the start. Soon after the engagement, Charles told his parents he had made a ""bloody awful"" mistake, and begged to be released, but to no avail. As the marriage faltered, he returned to an old love, Camilla Parker Bowles, whose own husband was philandering. Caught in this sorrowful triangle, Diana changed from naive young girl to angry, vengeful wife. But the major reason the marriage fell apart, we learn, was not Camilla, or even Diana's own relationships with other men, but Diana's destructive tantrums and deep hereditary depressions. In less than two years' time, Dempster has learned, she will liberate herself from the Prince of Wales and his family.As for Charles's brother Andrew, his marriage to Sarah Ferguson fared no better. Five months pregnant with their second child, she began a close friendship with Texan Steve Wyatt, and later she kept steady company with her ""financial advisor"" John Bryan. The authors provide the reasons for Sarah's reckless behavior and explain why Andrew remained tolerant for so long.In this intimate, anecdotal book, Dempster and Evans take the reader inside the private family meeting called to handle the crisis surrounding the ""Camillagate"" tapes. The authors present the reactions - including actual comments - of the Queen and Prince Philip, the manipulations of the Queen Mother, and the acid recriminations of Princess Anne. They also divulge the wrenching trauma of the Parker Bowles family and describe an extraordinary scene in which Camilla's father dresses down the Prince of Wales.Revealing, at times even shocking, Behind Palace Doors is nonetheless surprisingly sympathetic. The authors portray the British royals as spoiled, selfish, frequently wanton, yet in the end, supremely human.",,Putnam Adult,"Saturday, May 1, 1993",Price Starting at $6.12

Unfortunately, after inviting the Los Angeles Times to write an extensive profile extolling the liquid treasures of his collection, Roth finds himself the victim of a world-class wine heist.Enter Sam Levitt, former corporate lawyer, cultivated crime expert, and wine connoisseur. Called in by Roth’s insurance company, which is now saddled with a multimillion-dollar claim, Sam follows his leads—to Bordeaux and its magnificent vineyards, and to Provence to meet an eccentric billionaire collector who might possibly have an interest in the stolen wines. Along the way, bien sûr, he is joined by a beautiful and erudite French colleague, and together they navigate many a château, pausing frequently to enjoy the countryside’s abundant pleasures.The unraveling of the ingenious crime is threaded through with Mayle’s seductive rendering of France’s sensory delights—from a fine Lynch-Bages and Léoville Barton to the bouillabaisse of Marseille and the young lamb of Bordeaux.

It wasn't until he came to a spiritual crossroads and was able to give that dream up to discover the true desires of his heart before he actually got into the space shuttle program at NASA. Three failed attempts didn't daunt this driven pilot-and the fourth interview process, though lengthy and difficult, proved successful for him.

Certain Trumpets: The Call of Leaders,"By Wills, Garry","In his Pulitzer Prize- and National Book Critics Circle Award-winning Lincoln at Gettysburg, Garry Wills reframed our understanding of Lincoln the leader. Wills breathed new life into words we thought we knew and revealed much about a President so mythologized but often misunderstood. He showed how Lincoln's personality was less at issue than his followers' values and Lincoln's exquisite ability, in a mere 272 words, to reach them, to give the whole nation ""a new birth of freedom,"" and to weave a spell that has not yet been broken.Now Wills extends his extraordinary quality of observation and iconoclastic scholarship to examine the nature of leadership itself, perhaps history's most pivotal and emotionally charged topic. Almost the first thing people say about leaders is that we used to have them but now do not. Some blame this on the press, or on television, or on education. Others say we are manipulated, not led. Still others pore over book after book, searching for the perfect exemplar to imitate in order to achieve success.Wills offers a wide range of portraits drawn largely, but not exclusively, from American history and representing revolutionary, political, religious, business, artistic, sports, and military leaders - Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harriet Tubman, Eleanor Roosevelt, Andrew Young, Napoleon, King David, Ross Perot, George Washington, Socrates, Mary Baker Eddy, Carl Stotz, Martha Graham, Martin Luther King, Jr., Cesare Borgia, and Dorothy Day - each shown in the act of leading his or her followers. And after each example, Wills also provides an anti-type to help define the type better.He moves beyond the traditional study of elected officials and business giants, past the usual emphasis on glamour, forceful personality, or technique, to look at leaders of different scope and particular talents. Wills shows how leaders are shaped by the very circumstances in which they must shape others' actions. No one, after all, can be a leader without followers. Only the vital interplay of wills between leaders and followers can direct them both toward a goal.In Certain Trumpets leadership is not a static pose but becomes an exhilarating partnership. Once again Garry Wills has transformed the lens through which we see our leaders, our society, and ourselves."," History , General",Simon & Schuster,"Sunday, May 1, 1994",Price Starting at $5.47

When Samantha Rainford -- newly wed to Douglas Cosmo Rainford III -- returns home from her honeymoon to find divorce papers waiting, she's shocked and heartbroken. Then she discovers that she's not the first to be abandoned -- she's one of four (or maybe more) ex-Mrs. Rainfords -- and decides it's time to put into practice that old truism: Don't get mad, get even.   With the help of her longtime girlfriend Slick, a glamorous fashion model, Sam gathers together a highly unlikely team: Mrs. Kayla Rainford, an architect who moonlights as an exotic dancer; Mrs. Zoe Rainford, a plumber; and Mrs. Olivia Rainford, a former cheerleader and cartoon artist. Sam and Slick flunked out of FBI training school, but they still learned a few things there -- like how to plan a mission. And the fivesome is determined to do whatever it takes to bring down Douglas Rainford III.   Whatever it takes means attending a top-secret private special-ops training camp in the North Carolina mountains, where Sam meets fiercely disciplined ex-CIA operative Kollar Havapopulas. Six feet three and handsome as a Greek god, ""Pappy"" is the best at what he does -- transforming civilians into highly skilled fighting teams. What he's less adept at, however, is telling a woman how he feels, and before long he discovers he's developing some very warm feelings for Samantha Rainford -- an attraction that seems fated to be a total disaster.

Garten (Dean, School of Management, Yale U.) concludes that CEOs are not as powerful as many people think; that they know less than they think they do about international strategies; that they will have to begin devoting attention to employees, customers, suppliers, and communities; and although they need more trust from their employees because of the increasing value in creative workers, trust is harder to win.  Garten ultimately argues for a broader role for CEOs, and one less specifically focused on shareholder earnings. Annotation c.

The Wal-Mart Effect: How the World's Most Powerful Company Really Works--and HowIt's Transforming the American Economy,"By Fishman, Charles","An award-winning journalist breaks through the wall of secrecy to reveal the many astonishing ways Wal-Mart's power affects our lives and reaches all around the world.  The Wal-Mart Effect: The overwhelming impact of the world's largest company--due to its relentless pursuit of low prices--on retailers and manufacturers, wages and jobs, the culture of shopping, the shape of our communities, and the environment; a global force of unprecedented nature. Wal-Mart is not only the world's largest company; it is also the largest company in the history of the world. Americans spend $26 million every hour at Wal-Mart, twenty-four hours of every day, every day of the year. Is the company a good thing or a bad thing? On the one hand, market guru Warren Buffett estimates that the company's low prices save American consumers $10 billion a year. On the other, the behemoth is the #1 employer in thirty-seven of the fifty states yet has never let a union in the door.  Though 70 percent of Americans now live within a fifteen-minute drive of a Wal-Mart store, we have not even begun to understand the true power of the company and the many ways it is shaping American life. We know about the lawsuits and the labor protests, but what we don't know is how profoundly the ""Wal-Mart effect"" is shaping our lives.  Fast Company senior editor Fishman, whose revelatory cover story on Wal-Mart generated the strongest reader response in the history of the magazine, takes us on an unprecedented behind-the-scenes investigative expedition deep inside the many worlds of Wal-Mart. He reveals the radical ways in which the company is transforming America's economy, our workforce, our communities, and our environment. Fishman penetrated the secrecy of Wal-Mart headquarters, interviewing twenty-five high-level ex-executives; he journeyed into the world of a host of Wal-Mart's suppliers to uncover how the company strong-arms even the most established brands; and journeyed to the ports and factories, the fields and forests where Wal-Mart's power is warping the very structure of the world's market for goods. Wal-Mart is not just a retailer anymore, Fishman argues. It has become a kind of economic ecosystem, and anyone who wants to understand the forces shaping our world today must understand the company's hidden reach."," Social Science , Popular Culture","Penguin Press HC, The","Sunday, January 1, 2006",Price Starting at $4.99

The State of the Language: English Observed,"By Howard, Philip","Is the English language in decline?  Many people seem to think so--but Philip Howard isn't one of them.  The Literary Editor of The Times of London, Howard takes a robust, commonsensical view of the changes that are happening in English.  His is not the Panglossian attitude that all is neccessarily for the best in the best of all possible languages, but he does feel that change is necessary--and healthy--in any living language.    Howard here examines the language in its various branches and categories, such as grammar and pronunciation, spelling and punctuation, dialect and slang.  He discusses the effect the new technologies, from cable TV to photocomposition, are having on the mother tongue, and he examines the new dialects that are coming into use.  He navigates the back streets of euphemism and the broad, boring boulevards of cliche.  He asks whether the language is actually changing as fast as we suppose, and, if so, why.    Howard argues that as far as we can, we should strive to direct and control the changes in English in ways that increase its power.  And where we can't help it, he says, we should lie back and enjoy its immense richness, which is unrivaled by any other language. Rather than have us wring our hands, Philip Howard entreats us, with his customary with and erudition, to use our tongues in concert with our brains.

Second Chance: Three Presidents and the Crisis of American Superpower,"By Brzezinski, Zbigniew","A story of wasted opportunity and squandered prestige: a critique of the last three U.S. presidents' foreign policy. Distinguished commentator on foreign policy, former National Security Adviser Brzezinski, offers a reasoned but unsparing assessment of the last three presidential administrations' foreign policy. Though spanning less than two decades, these administrations cover a vitally important turning point in world history: the period in which the United States, having emerged from the Cold War withunprecedented power and prestige, managed to squander both in a remarkably short time. This is a tale of decline: from the competent but conventional thinking of the first Bush administration, to the well-intentioned self-indulgence of the Clinton administration, to the mortgaging of America's future by the ""suicidal statecraft"" of the second Bush administration. Brzezinski concludes with a chapter on how America can regain its lost prestige.

From Alfred to Henry III; 871-1272,"By Brooke, Christopher","The 400 years covered by this volume saw two Danish invasions and the Norman Conquest of England. Each conquest carried with it extensive political and social changes. Alfred began the work of creating a unified kingdom out of the shambles of the smaller kingdoms that had fallen under Viking raids. The ninth and tenth centuries saw the settlement of the Danes and the eleventh the emergence of a strong monarchy under the Danish King Cnut. ""With the English kingdom grew up the first semblance of national institutions,"" writes Professor Brooks--institutions of central and local government which made the English monarchy among the most mature in the Europe of its time.... These established institutions were not destroyed by the Normans; they adapted and developed them.Although England had had close ties with the continent before the Conquest, after 1066 English cultural and social life was greatly enriched through the French influence. During this time the Church was finding new inspiration in monastic and papal reform and a great intellectual revival culminated in the creation of universities. Professor Brooke describes all the cultural and political developments of these years and shows how the reign of Henry III ushered in a ""great age of art and architecture"" and a ""new attitude to government,"" which began to work by consent of the governed."," Language Arts & Disciplines , General",W.

A Democracy at War: America's Fight at Home and Abroad in World War II,"By O'Neill, William L","As America fought to defend democratic ideals in Europe and Asia during World War II, our own democratic politics at home paradoxically created a far less than efficient war effort on both civilian and military fronts. While America's glorious triumphs in World War II are well known, the story of our country's failure to swiftly and effectively mobilize and energize our war machine is yet to be fully told. Now, in a broad-ranged domestic, military, and diplomatic history, William O'Neill tells the story of America's strengths and its weaknesses in fighting the Good War.The United States won its victory in World War II not, as legend has it, because of superior numbers and material predominance. Reluctant even to enter the war, the American government proceeded by costly half-measures even after committing to fight. Official reticence and bureaucratic bungling led to inferior and defective weapons, too few infantrymen, the squandering of GI's lives in strategically useless attacks, and other tragic mistakes. The Sherman tank was a deathtrap and the torpedoes of American submarines routinely malfunctioned. Afraid to alarm voters, Congress failed to act on many issues, such as the decision to increase military spending before the war, which could have brought the conflict to a faster end, with less bloodshed. O'Neill traces much of the official bungling to domestic politics and paradoxically to the democratic process itself, which limited Roosevelt's flexibility in wartime.Yet, despite these obstacles, the blood and valor of the men who fought and the strength and struggles of those who remained at home made up for an overly cautious and ambivalent democratic leadership. William O'Neill brings this war generation to life to tell the story of the country which had long seemed willing to ignore the world but ultimately roused itself to defend it."," History , General",Free Press,"Monday, November 1, 1993",Price Starting at $10.99

Thin Is the New Happy,"By Frankel, Valerie","“Val Frankel is a woman of amazing insight. . . . Read this, weep, and heal.”—Stacy London, cohost of What Not to WearYou’ve heard the phrase “the mirror is not your friend.” For Valerie Frankel, the mirror was so much more than “not a friend.” It was the mean girl who stole her lunch money, bitch-slapped her in the ladies’ room, and cut the hair off her Barbie. If you’re like 99.9 percent of women, the war you wage with yourself over your body image begins at the ripe age of eight, and the skirmishes are fought for the next eight decades. Sometimes you don’t even know when you’ve won. (How many of us have taken out a photo from high school and thought, “Hey! I looked great—why didn’t I know it?”) This book is for anyone who has spent most of her life on—or thinking about being on—a diet. It’s for anyone who ever wished for candlelight in dressing rooms. It’s for anyone who has ever owned a pair of “fat pants.” In short, this book is for anyone who ever felt good or bad about themselves based on how they look. Valerie Frankel, like most women, has spent most of her conscious life on a diet, thinking about a diet, ignoring a diet, or failing on a diet. At age eleven, her mother put Val on her first weight-loss program. As a teen, she was enrolled in Weight Watchers (for which she invented creative ditching methods). As a young woman, her world felt right only when she was able to zip a certain pair of jeans. Not wanting to pass this legacy on to her own daughters, Valerie set out to cleanse herself of her obsession. Thin Is the New Happy is the true story of one woman’s quest to exorcise her bad body-image demons, to uncover the truths behind what put them there, and to learn how to truly love herself. It’s a poignant, hilarious, and all-out honest account of one woman’s struggle with body image—the filter through which she’s always seen the world—and the way she ultimately overcame it."," Biography & Autobiography , Women",St. Martin's Press,"Monday, September 1, 2008",Price Starting at $5.29
Ted Kennedy: Scenes from an Epic Life,"By Boston Globe and Kerry, John (FRW)","The extraordinary life of senator Edward Moore Kennedy captures two vivid stories: one is of an iconic senator who experienced the greatest of triumphs and the most devastating of losses, and the other is a chronicle of the most dramatic moments in our recent American history, including the assassination of a president and the struggle for civil rights. Through more than two hundred stunning black-and-white photographs pulled from the pages of The Boston Globe and its extensive archives, Ted Kennedy: Scenes from an Epic Life provides a gorgeous visual account of Ted's incredible journey from his joyous birth to the tragic announcement of his battle with brain cancer, including highlights from his childhood in New York, Hyannis Port, and London; his days at Harvard and in the Senate; and his roles as devoted brother, husband, father, uncle, and grandfather.In this unique collection, archival materials and fresh interviews combine to create a richly detailed portrait of the man known to many as Uncle Ted. Vibrant photographs, most never before published in book form (and many unseen for decades), as well as essays and quotations illustrate the man and the statesman from a perspective that is both intimate and objective. It is a collection in which Ted's closest and keenest observers provide the context necessary to appreciate his place in this most famous of American families.Here you will find, among the many unforgettable photographs featured in these pages, contributions by such illustrious names as Stan Grossfeld, Ulrike Welsch, Ollie Noonan Jr., Paul J. Connell, and Ted Dully. Featured essays include the reflections of the Globe's former Washington bureau chief, Martin F. Nolan, and longtime photojournalist Bill Brett. Their images and words bear eyewitness testimony that will resonate with anyone who lived through the Camelot years or simply seeks to understand the Kennedy mystique. Ted Kennedy: Scenes from an Epic Life has no equal because Ted Kennedy's long, complicated relationship with the press has no equal.

The Triumph of Katie Byrne,"By Bradford, Barbara Taylor","Barbara Taylor Bradford takes her legendary storytelling to an exciting new level in this stunning, suspenseful tale about a young woman whose life is shattered by an unspeakable crime. Seventeen-year-old Katie Byrne stands shivering in the cold Connecticut woods, her flashlight illuminating a scene out of a nightmare. Carly, one of her two closest friends, lies beaten and unconscious, her face covered in blood. Moments later, the horror escalates when Katie's brother discovers the lifeless body of Denise, the third member of their inseparable trio. Nearby is the old barn where only hours before the three girls joyfully rehearsed Shakespearean speeches for an upcoming school performance. For Katie, who returned to the makeshift theatre to retrieve schoolbooks she had forgotten in her haste to get home early, the tragedy marks the end of a long-shared dream. The girls began acting together as ten-year olds with stars in their eyes, fantasizing about the day they would all move to New York and take Broadway by storm. Now, only Katie can realize the dream. Ten years later, Katie, a tall, lanky beauty with reddish-gold hair, is a struggling actress in New York. Haunted by the memory of Denise's death and by thoughts of Carly, who still lies in a coma, she longs for the fame and celebrity they imagined together so long before. After an acclaimed performance Katie finally wins a starring role on Broadway and begins a promising love affair. But before she can step into the spotlight, Katie must escape the dark shadows of the past. In sixteen previous bestselling novels, Barbara Taylor Bradford has enthralled millions of readers with page-turning plots and characters that linger in the heart and mind long after the book is closed.

American Places: Encounters with History,"By Meyer, Sheldon (EDT) and Leuchtenburg, William E. (EDT)","For anyone interested in history, the physical traces of the past, especially historical places, hold a special fascination. Whether it is a battlefield or the home of a notable American, there is no question that we understand the past in a different and more immediate way when we encounter it ""on the ground.""     In American Places, more than two dozen of America's most gifted historians write about their own encounters with historic places, bringing a personal viewpoint to bear on a wide variety of sites, ranging from Monticello to Fenway Park. Here James M. McPherson writes about the battlefield of Gettysburg, and how walking the ground of Pickett's Charge inspired one of his books. Kevin Starr visits the Musso & Frank Grill in Hollywood and finds many of the flavors of California history there. Joel Williamson takes a bemused tour of Elvis Presley's Graceland, and David Kennedy tells the story of the ""Pig War"" of San Juan Island, where a spat between Britain and America over a speck of land in the Pacific helped determine the shape of the U.S. and Canada. William Freehling compares two places, Charleston's Battery and New Orleans' Jackson Square, showing how each reveals the different spirit of the society that created it. And Edward Ayers talks about spending time in Cyberspace, U.S.A., a virtual place that has much in common with the America visited by Alexis de Tocqueville a century and a half ago. Other pieces include Robert Dallek on the FDR Memorial, David Hackett Fischer on the Boston Common, and William Leuchtenburg on his native borough of Queens.     American Places celebrates the career of Sheldon Meyer, who over his years at Oxford University Press has published some of our most distinguished historians, including many Pulitzer Prize and Bancroft Prize winners, virtually all of whom have contributed to this volume."," History , United States , 20th Century",Oxford University Press,"Wednesday, November 1, 2000",Price Starting at $4.99

Inside the Helmet: A Player's Eye View of the N.F.L.,"By King, Peter","To the unsophisticated eye, football is a simple game. Eleven hulking behemoths line up on one side of a football; another eleven line up across from them. When the ball is snapped, both sides erupt into a single writhing, violent mass of bodies. Then, when everyone stops moving, they line up and do it again.Just because football doesn't look neat and precise doesn't mean that it lacks order. In fact, each seemingly chaotic play is the result of analysis, planning, practice, split-second adjustments, and the executions of well-rehearsed movements. And, because every player on the field is involved in the success or failure of each play, the attention to detail in football is mind-boggling.In Inside the Helmet, Peter King, Sports Illustrated's lead pro football columnist, takes us inside the world of professional football and shows us the game only the players and coaches see. As he profiles football's best and brightest, King shows us the intricacies of each position and why attention to detail wins and loses games. He shares a week with Boomer Esiason as he prepares for a game and shows us how his endless hours of film study and pregame preparation translate into action on the field. He shows us how a one-man gang like Bruce Smith can change a game with his speed, strength, and technique and what an offense must do to contain him. He takes us inside the high-stakes game within the game played by league-leading pass receiver Hayward Jeffires and all-pro defensive back Rod Woodson as they face off against each other play after play. He also shows us how Barry Sanders, the game's best running back, finds a hole, as well as what he sees, feels, and senses as he slices through a defense.Inside the Helmet shows us what football coaches really do. We fly across the country with one of the game's best, Jimmy Johnson, as he and his staff look for talent, and watch as they work the phone on draft day. King also shows us how a head coach supervises his team as they get ready for a big game and explains why today's head coaches are more likely to act like business executives than fat guys holding a blocking sled. Finally, King takes us inside the much overlooked kicking game, and explains why all successful coaches say that ""special teams"" are what win or lose championships.Peter King's sources are impeccable, his access is unique, and his understanding and love of the game are unparalleled.

A hero in Israel's wars, perhaps the most daring and successful commander in Israel's extraordinary military history, Sharon has always been a warrior, whether the enemies were hostile Arab nations, terrorists, Time magazine, or rival politicians.

In this compelling and dramatic auto-biography, the real Sharon appears for the first time: a complex man, a loving father, a figure of courage and compassion. He is a warrior who commands the respect and love of his troops, a visionary, and an uncompromising, ruthless pragmatist. Sharon tells his story with frankness, power, intelligence, and a brilliant gift for detail.

The Marines of Autumn: A Novel of the Korean War,"By Brady, James","War has been the inspiration of such great novels as The Red Badge of Courage and A Farewell to Arms, and daring feats of courage and tragic mistakes have been the foundation for such classic works.  Now, for the first time ever, the Korean War has a novel that captures that courage and sacrifice.When Captain Thomas Verity, USMC, is called back to action, he must leave his Georgetown home, career, and young daughter and rush to Korea to monitor Chinese radio transmissions.  At first acting in an advisory role, he is abruptly thrust into MacArthur's last daring and disastrous foray-the Chosin Reservoir campaign-and then its desperate retreat. Time magazine at the time recounted the retreat this way: ""The running fight of the Marines...was a battle unparalleled in U.S. military history.  It had some aspects of Bataan, some of Anzio, some of Dunkirk, some of Valley Forge, and some of 'the retreat of the 10,000' as described in Xenophon's Anabasis."" The Marines of Autumn is a stunning, shattering novel of war illuminated only by courage, determination, and Marine Corps discipline.  And by love: of soldier for soldier, of men and their women, and of a small girl in Georgetown, whose father promised she would dance with him on the bridges of Paris.

Small cap stocks are best for all time. Bunk! A trade deficit is bad for markets. Bunk! Stocks can't rise on high unemployment. Bunk!  Many investors think they are safest following widely accepted Wall Street wisdom—but much of Wall Street wisdom isn't so wise. In fact, it can be costly bunk. In Debunkery: Learn It, Do It, and Profit From It—Seeing Through Wall Street's Money-Killing Myths, Ken Fisher—named one of the 30 most influential individuals of the last three decades by Investment Advisor magazine—details why so many investors fail to get the long-term results they desire.

Your goal as an investor shouldn't be to be error-free—that's impossible. Rather, to be more successful, you should aim to lower your error rate.

The Creation of the Future: The Role of the American University,"By Rhodes, Frank Harold Trevor","Is the university a dinosaur: huge, lumbering, endearing in its own way, yet unsuited to today's world? Is it a thing of the past, unnecessary in an age of the Internet and online learning? In a book likely to provoke people who are loyal to the ideal of the university as well as those who foresee its demise, Frank H. T. Rhodes acknowledges that the university is an imperfect institution, but argues that it plays an essential role in modern society. In the process, he articulates strong opinions on a range of difficult issues.  The Creation of the Future is no defense or promotion of the status quo. Focusing on American research universities, Rhodes makes the case that they are an irreplaceable resource, quite literally a national and international treasure, whose value must be preserved through judicious renewal and reform, beginning with a rededication to teaching as a moral vocation. Rhodes discusses where the research university is today and how it got here, as well as where it must go in the future. In the process, he addresses a wide range of contemporary challenges facing the institution, including*why universities can no longer be ""ivory towers""*why post-tenure review of professors is desirable*whether grading standards have become too lax*why unionization of graduate students is inappropriate*why affirmative action is necessary*how governance and leadership can be improved*how to maintain a sense of commitment to the university in the face of increasing disciplinary specialization*why faculty must affirm that university membership has not only its privileges, but also its price.*what should and should not be done to control the rapid rise in tuition.*whether curricula of professional schools should be more heavily weighted toward the liberal arts.*why service is a social obligation of all universities, not just land-grant institutions.*why research is vital to effective teaching.His eighteen-year tenure as president of Cornell University gives Rhodes a unique perspective on a system he finds both invaluable and in need of change. Although he is an enthusiastic advocate, he pulls no punches in recommending sweeping changes. The greatest catastrophe facing universities today, he writes, is loss of community: ""Without community, knowledge becomes idiosyncratic. The lone learner, studying in isolation, is vulnerable to narrowness, dogmatism, and untested assumption; pursued in community, learning will be expansive and informed, contested by opposing interpretations, leavened by differing experience, and refined by alternative viewpoints.""In championing a new relevance for the American research university, Rhodes argues for renewal through the application of old virtues to new realities. Campus culture, he says, must embrace the human experience in all its richness, breadth, and ambiguity if it is to survive and thrive."," Education , Research",Cornell University Press,"Monday, October 1, 2001",Price Starting at $4.99

A magnificent fantasy of men, Kings, sorcerers, and Gods caught up in a death struggle between two ancient, warring Destinies—the culmination of a seven-thousand-year war of Good and Evil.The infant son of Garion and Ce’Ndra had been foully kidnapped. Now they began the great quest to rescue the child, with the immortal Begarath the Sorcerer, his daughter Polgara the Sorceress, and inevitably the little Drasnian, Silk.Guided by the Orb of the God Aldur, their way led through the foul swamps of Nyissa, then into the lands of the Murgos. And at the end, they must face a horrible danger—to themselves and to all mankind. For the Dark Prophecy had not vanished when Garion slew the evil God Torak. Instead, it had fled to Zandramas, who was now the Child of Dark. Dark and Light still contended for mastery, and Zandramas planned to use the child in some rite and the Sardion Stone to insure that the Dark would triumph.If they could not be at that impossible place when Zandramas arrived, they would lose—forever.",,Del Rey,"Wednesday, February 1, 1989",Price Starting at $4.99
"Joint Air Operations: Pursuit of Unity in Command and Control, 1942-1991 (A Rand Research Study)","By Winnefeld, James A. and Johnson, Dana J.","With the current downsizing of the U.S. military putting a premium on joint response to threats, this landmark study of joint U.S. air operations over the past fifty years provides timely information on a topic of vital concern. The most comprehensive single-volume discussion available, it examines six major air campaigns - Midway, the Solomon Islands, Korea, Vietnam, El Dorado Canyon (Libya), and Desert Storm - in a search for lessons learned that might be applied in the planning and organizing of future joint operations.The focus of the book is on the differences - at times bitter acrimony - among the services on the control and employment of theater air forces. With each service having an ""air force"" of its own, each with a distinctive doctrine, the study confirms that their views are often diametrically opposite and that joint doctrine has been slow to evolve.The authors, RAND Corporation analysts, are refreshingly objective and clear in addressing the problems and issues that continue to hamper effective joint air operations but point to the progress shown in Desert Storm, as indicated by their interviews with some fifty airmen, planners, and major commanders of the operation. Their recommendations for the future take advantage of the diversity inherent in U.S. air power while minimizing sources of disharmony.Based on a RAND study published in 1991, this book has been expanded and revised to appeal to a broader audience and promises to stimulate discussion and debate on how to optimize the effectiveness of U.S. forces facing cuts in funding. It is must reading not only for military professionals but for military history enthusiasts and everyone interested in the nature of America's future air battles."," Technology & Engineering , Military Science",Naval Inst Pr,"Saturday, May 1, 1993",Price Starting at $4.99

The Forgotten Ways: Reactivating the Missional Church,"By Sweet, Leonard (FRW) and Hirsch, Alan","Alan Hirsch is convinced that the inherited formulas for growing the Body of Christ do not work anymore. And rather than relying on slightly revised solutions from the past, he sees a vision of the future growth of the church coming about by harnessing the power of the early church, which grew from as few as 25,000 adherents in AD 100 to up to 20 million in AD 310. Such incredible growth is also being experienced today in the church in China and other parts of the world. How do they do it?The Forgotten Ways explores the concept of Apostolic Genius as a way to understand what caused the church to expand at various times in history, interpreting it for use in our own time and place. From the theological underpinnings to the practical application, Hirsch takes the reader through this dynamic mixture of passion, prayer, and incarnational practice to rediscover the dormant potential of the modern church in the West."," Religion , Christian Church , Growth",Brazos Press,"Wednesday, April 1, 2009",Price Starting at $5.29

Japan Unbound: A Volatile Nation's Quest for Pride and Purpose,"By Nathan, John","Not since World War II has Japan faced a crisis like the one before it now. An apparently endless recession has weakened the foundations of the traditional family and severed the bond between Japan's corporations and employees. Unruly children turn classrooms into battlefields. Ultranationalist pride and xenophobia are celebrated in best-selling comic books and championed by media superstars, including the governor of Tokyo. Upheavals across the society have significant ramifications for America. As the Japanese reject their traditions wholesale, they view their half-century-old connection to the United States with mounting skepticism.Drawing on his fluent Japanese and unmatched intimacy with the culture, John Nathan reveals a nation newly unmoored from the traditions that have shored it up and sometimes stifled it. Dramatic changes in business are augured by Carlos Ghosn, the Brazilian president of Nissan, once scorned as an outsider, now hailed for reviving a moribund giant. The soft-spoken artist Yoshinori Kobayashi foments and reflects rabid nationalism among millions with his hugely popular comic books. Yasuo Tanaka, a puckish writer and bon vivant, wins the governorship of Nagano and revolutionizes Japanese politics with his radical populism.Nathan delves beyond Japan's celebrities to map the epic shifts in daily life. He unveils the horrors of the Japanese school system. He goes inside a ""career transition service"" to witness the novel, nuanced rituals of job-hunting Japanese-style. He takes the pulse of ordinary citizens who are caught up in the country's many profound social shifts: agitprop pop culture, emerging feminism, environmentalism, teenage consumerism, entrepreneurship, and more.With immediacy and élan, John Nathan dispels conventional wisdom about Japan and replaces it with a brilliant vision of a country roiling with pride, uncertainty, creativity, fear, and hope."," History , Asia , Japan",Houghton Mifflin Harcourt,"Sunday, February 1, 2004",Price Starting at $5.29

Tumbling After,"By Witcover, Paul","The long-awaited second novel by Paul Witcover, acclaimed author of the remarkable Waking Beauty, is a stunning and provocative masterwork ofingenious imagination -- part-coming-of-age story, part contemporary fairy tale, part technological nightmare, and a brilliant dark vision of dystopia. Twelve-year-old twins Jack and Jilly Doone are closer than most siblings -- uncannily linked, sharing thoughts, sensations, and emotions as if one person -- as they enjoy a mostly parentless August at the Delaware shore. But in the fury of an onrushing hurricane, a frighteningly close brush with death awakens an awesome power in Jack that changes everything ...On an alternate Earth -- transformed centuries earlier by the Viral Wars into a savage battleground where the ""normal"" followers of the emperor Pluribus Unum clash unceasingly with warriors of five mutated elemental races -- a young aerie named Kestrel sets out into the perilous Waste with four companions, trusting their fates to the great and powerful Odds. Taking the next all-important step in every ""mute's"" odyssey to adulthood and duty, Kestrel dreams of glory and sacrifice, and of single-handedly bringing about the total extermination of the hated ""norm"" enemy. But even his ability to soar high above his world will not help him escape the treachery of those he dares not trust, and his psionic powers over the winds cannot blow away the strange and shattering destiny that awaits him at journey's end.A different yet oddly synchronistic fate looms for Jack Doone in this endgame summer of frightening discovery and forbidden experimentation. Suddenly cursed with the uncontrollable power to alter reality -- to ""do over"" events and change the flow of his life and the lives of those around him -- his day-to-day existence has become a twisted version of the ""Mutes and Norms"" role-playing game devised and orchestrated by his uncle Jimmy. And now the twins' survival may come down to a single roll of the cosmic dice, as Jack finds himself devastatingly alone for the first time, his cherished Jilly's protector in a terrifying battle to determine the real, armed with no weapon but memory.A staggeringly original work that blurs the lines between reality and the fantastic, between the accepted and the taboo, between fantasy and science fiction, Paul Witcover's Tumbling After is proof positive that intelligence and invention still reign supreme in the thrilling literature of speculation."," Fiction , Fantasy , General",Eos,"Tuesday, March 1, 2005",Price Starting at $5.93

Living History,"By Clinton, Hillary Rodham","Hillary Rodham Clinton is known to hundreds of millions of people around the world. Yet few beyond her close friends and family have ever heard her account of her extraordinary journey. She writes with candor, humor and passion about her upbringing in suburban, middle-class America in the 1950s and her transformation from Goldwater Girl to student activist to controversial First Lady. Living History is her revealing memoir of life through the White House years. It is also her chronicle of living history with Bill Clinton, a thirty-year adventure in love and politics that survives personal betrayal, relentless partisan investigations and constant public scrutiny.  Hillary Rodham Clinton came of age during a time of tumultuous social and political change in America. Like many women of her generation, she grew up with choices and opportunities unknown to her mother or grandmother. She charted her own course through unexplored terrain -- responding to the changing times and her own internal compass -- and became an emblem for some and a lightning rod for others. Wife, mother, lawyer, advocate and international icon, she has lived through America's great political wars, from Watergate to Whitewater.  The only First Lady to play a major role in shaping domestic legislation, Hillary Rodham Clinton traveled tirelessly around the country to champion health care, expand economic and educational opportunity and promote the needs of children and families, and she crisscrossed the globe on behalf of women's rights, human rights and democracy. She redefined the position of First Lady and helped save the presidency from an unconstitutional, politically motivated impeachment. Intimate, powerful and inspiring, Living History captures the essence of one of the most remarkable women of our time and the challenging process by which she came to define herself and find her own voice -- as a woman and as a formidable figure in American politics."," Biography & Autobiography , Historical",Simon & Schuster,"Sunday, June 1, 2003",Price Starting at $8.79

La Bella Figura: A Field Guide to the Italian Mind,"By Severgnini, Beppe","Join the bestselling author of Ciao, America! on a lively tour of modern Italy that takes you behind the seductive face it puts on for visitors—la bella figura—and highlights its maddening, paradoxical true self You won’t need luggage for this hypothetical and hilarious trip into the hearts and minds of Beppe Severgnini’s fellow Italians. In fact, Beppe would prefer if you left behind the baggage his crafty and elegant countrymen have smuggled into your subconscious. To get to his Italia, you’ll need to forget about your idealized notions of Italy. Although La Bella Figura will take you to legendary cities and scenic regions, your real destinations are the places where Italians are at their best, worst, and most authentic: The highway: in America, a red light has only one possible interpretation—Stop! An Italian red light doesn’t warn or order you as much as provide an invitation for reflection. The airport: where Italians prove that one of their virtues (an appreciation for beauty) is really a vice. Who cares if the beautiful girls hawking cell phones in airport kiosks stick you with an outdated model? That’s the price of gazing upon perfection.The small town: which demonstrates the Italian genius for pleasant living: “a congenial barber . . . a well-stocked newsstand . . . professionally made coffee and a proper pizza; bell towers we can recognize in the distance, and people with a kind word and a smile for everyone.”The chaos of the roads, the anarchy of the office, the theatrical spirit of the hypermarkets, and garrulous train journeys; the sensory reassurance of a church and the importance of the beach; the solitude of the soccer stadium and the crowded Italian bedroom; the vertical fixations of the apartment building and the horizontal democracy of the eat-in kitchen. As you venture to these and many other locations rooted in the Italian psyche, you realize that Beppe has become your Dante and shown you a country that “has too much style to be hell” but is “too disorderly to be heaven.” Ten days, thirty places. From north to south. From food to politics. From saintliness to sexuality. This ironic, methodical, and sentimental examination will help you understand why Italy—as Beppe says—“can have you fuming and then purring in the space of a hundred meters or ten minutes.”"," Travel , Europe , Italy",Crown,"Friday, June 1, 2007",Price Starting at $5.29
Victoria Victorious: The Story of Queen Victoria,"By Plaidy, Jean","In this unforgettable novel of Queen Victoria, Jean Plaidy re-creates a remarkable   life filled with romance, triumph, and tragedy. At birth, Princess Victoria was   fourth in line for the throne of England, the often-overlooked daughter of a prince   who died shortly after her birth. She and her mother lived in genteel poverty for   most of her childhood, exiled from court because of her mother’s dislike of her uncles,   George IV and William IV. A strong, willful child, Victoria was determined not to   be stifled by her powerful uncles or her unpopular, controlling mother. Then one   morning, at the age of eighteen, Princess Victoria awoke to the news of her uncle   William’s death. The almost-forgotten princess was now Queen of England. Even better,   she was finally free of her mother’s iron hand and her uncles’ manipulations. Her   first act as queen was to demand that she be given a room—and a bed—of her own. Victoria’s marriage to her German cousin, Prince Albert, was a blissfully happy one   that produced nine children. Albert was her constant companion and one of her most   trusted advisors. Victoria’s grief after Prince Albert’s untimely death was so shattering   that for the rest of her life—nearly forty years—she dressed only in black. She survived   several assassination attempts, and during her reign England’s empire expanded around   the globe until it touched every continent in the world. Derided as a mere “girl   queen” at her coronation, by the end of her sixty-four-year reign, Victoria embodied   the glory of the British Empire. In this novel, written as a “memoir” by Victoria   herself, she emerges as truthful, sentimental, and essentially human—both a lovable   woman and a great queen."," Fiction , Historical , General",Crown,"Sunday, May 1, 2005",Price Starting at $5.29

"The Old Neighborhood: What We Lost in the Great Suburban Migration, 1966-1999","By Suarez, Ray","""Life in the city, for the millions who lived it, was once something less than the sum of their lifestyle choices: they woke up, they ate, they shoveled coal, loved, hated, prayed, mated, reproduced, died. For most, the home was not a display object but a place to keep the few things they had managed to hold on to from the surpluses produced by their labor. Their material life was made of the things they didn't have to eat, wear, or burn right this minute. A concertina maybe? A family Bible? A hunting rifle?""  This life in ""the old neighborhood,"" so lyrically captured by Ray Suarez, was once lived by a huge number of Americans. One in seven of us can directly connect our lineage through just one city, Brooklyn. In 1950, except for Los Angeles, the top ten American cities were all in the Northeast or Midwest, and all had populations over 800,000. Since then, especially since the mid-60s, a way of life has simply vanished.  Ray Suarez, veteran interviewer and host of NPR's ""Talk of the Nation®,"" is a child of Brooklyn who has long been fascinated with the stories behind the largest of our once-great cities. He has talked to longtime residents, recent arrivals, and recent departures; community organizers, priests, cops, and politicians; and scholars who have studied neighborhoods, demographic trends, and social networks. The result is a rich tapestry of voices and history. The Old Neighborhood captures a crucial chapter in the experience of postwar America. It is a book not just for first- and second-generation Americans, but for anyone who remembers the prewar cities or wonders how we could have gotten to where we are. It is a book about ""old neighborhoods"" that were once cherished, and are now lost."," Social Science , Sociology , General",Free Press,"Saturday, May 1, 1999",Price Starting at $5.29

The Power of Nice: How to Negotiate So Everyone Wins - Especially You!,"By Dale, Jim, Shapiro, Ronald M., Jankowski, Mark A., and Ripkin, Cal (FRW)","One of the most successful dealmakers in the sports industry presents his unique negotiating strategies""Ron Shapiro's new book is insightful and entertaining. The lessons he learned and the methods he uses should be required reading for anyone whose business relies on the art of negotiation. Ron never forgets that treating people with respect and fairness is the key to success. Ron and Mark have been helping our company for many years-I guess we won't need them anymore-they put it all in their book.""—Charles M. Cawley, Chief Executive Officer, MBNA America Bank, N.A.""In the field of negotiation Ron Shapiro has always been regarded as the quintessence of class and integrity. Predictably, he and Mark Jankowski have written a compelling book filled with anecdotes and insights.The Power of Nice is a fascinating and useful book that is a must read for anyone who wants to build long-term mutually profitable relationships.""—Herb Cohen, Author, You Can Negotiate Anything""This book taught me everything I ever wanted to know about negotiation-and I use it everyday.""—Kirby Puckett, Former All-Star Center Fielder and Executive Vice President, Minnesota Twins""Negotiation is not war. Negotiation is not a science. Negotiation is the commerce of information for ultimate gain.""—from The Power of NiceThough not a science, negotiating is an art, and in this eye-opening new book, a true master shares his secrets and strategies for success. Ron Shapiro is a corporate lawyer, teacher, and, in what is almost a contradiction in terms, one of today's most respected sports agents. He has worked with baseball's biggest names: Cal Ripken, Jr., Kirby Puckett, Brooks Robinson, Dennis Martinez, Jim Palmer, Eddie Murray, and many others. Rising to-and remaining at-the top of a competitive pool filled with smooth-talking, ""sleazeball"" sharks, he has succeeded by being, of all things, a nice guy. Now, along with his business partner, lawyer, lecturer, and negotiations expert, Mark Jankowski, Shapiro reveals how anyone who sits down to make a deal can get what they want by exercising the surprising ""power of nice."" Together, Shapiro and Jankowski have shared their negotiation insights with Fortune 500 companies, entrepreneurs, universities, and government agencies.Though the name of the game in negotiating is to obtain desired results, how you get them is just as important. While many dealmakers play hardball by assuming a winner-take-all, scorched-earth attitude, they do so at the risk of alienating the party opposite them at the negotiating table, thereby losing out on future opportunities. This approach is, as Shapiro and Jankowski tell us, a major strike against effective negotiating, and can-and should-be avoided. By using a kinder, gentler approach that focuses on forming-and keeping-strong business connections, ultimate gain can still be yours: ""You can be 'a nice guy' and still get what you're after. In fact, you often get better results, achieve more of your goals, and build longer-term relationships with even greater returns.""Drawing on their vast experience in win-win negotiating, as well as such essentials as managing tough situations, handling difficult negotiators, and unlocking deadlocks, the authors take you, step-by-step, through a systematic approach that, when repeated and mastered, will maximize results. Based on ""the three Ps,"" it consists of: preparing better than the other side; probing so you know what they want and why; and proposing, ideally without going first and revealing too much, but still achieving what you want.Supported by invaluable ""portable"" negotiation summaries-so you can take the ""power of nice"" with you-this is must reading for anyone who has to make a deal, whether it's negotiating with a customer, s"," Business & Economics , Negotiating",Wiley,"Saturday, September 1, 2001",Price Starting at $5.29

The Sense of Beauty: Being the Outline of Aesthetic Theory,"By Santayana, George","It is remarkably appropriate that this work on aesthetics should have been written by George Santayana, who is probably the most brilliant philosophic writer and the philosopher with the strongest sense of beauty since Plato. It is not a dry metaphysical treatise, as works on aesthetics so often are, but is itself a fascinating document: as much a revelation of the beauty of language as of the concept of beauty.This unabridged reproduction of the 1896 edition of lectures delivered at Harvard College is a study of ""why, when, and how beauty appears, what conditions an object must fulfill to be beautiful, what elements of our nature make us sensible of beauty, and what the relation is between the constitution of the object and the excitement of our susceptibility.""Santayana first analyzes the nature of beauty, finding it irrational, ""pleasure regarded as the quality of a thing."" He then proceeds to the materials of beauty, showing what all human functions can contribute: love, social instincts, senses, etc. Beauty of form is then analyzed, and finally the author discusses the expression of beauty. Literature, religion, values, evil, wit, humor, and the possibility of finite perfection are all examined. Presentation throughout the work is concrete and easy to follow, with examples drawn from art, history, anthropology, psychology, and similar areas."," Philosophy , General",Dover Publications,"Wednesday, June 1, 1955",Price Starting at $4.99

Peace Like a River: A Novel,"By Enger, Leif","Hailed as one of the year's top five novels by Time, and selected as one of the best books of the year by nearly all major newspapers, national bestseller Peace Like a River captured the hearts of a nation in need of comfort. ""A rich mixture of adventure, tragedy, and healing,"" Peace Like a River is ""a collage of legends from sources sacred and profane -- from the Old Testament to the Old West, from the Gospels to police dramas"" (Ron Charles, The Christian Science Monitor). In ""lyrical, openhearted prose"" (Michael Glitz, The New York Post), Enger tells the story of eleven-year-old Reuben Land, an asthmatic boy who has reason to believe in miracles. Along with his sister and father, Reuben finds himself on a cross-country search for his outlaw older brother who has been controversially charged with murder. Their journey is touched by serendipity and the kindness of strangers, and its remarkable conclusion shows how family, love, and faith can stand up to the most terrifying of enemies, the most tragic of fates. Leif Enger's ""miraculous"" (Valerie Ryan, The Seattle Times) novel is a ""perfect book for an anxious time ... of great literary merit that nonetheless restores readers' faith in the kindness of stories"" (Marta Salij, Detroit Free Press)."," Fiction , Sagas",Atlantic Monthly Press,"Thursday, August 1, 2002",Price Starting at $4.99

Breathing Room,"By Phillips, Susan Elizabeth","Join the New York Times bestselling author on a journey to the sun-washed hills of Tuscany.

She's Dr. Isabel Favor, America's diva of self-help.He's Ren Gage, Hollywood's favorite villain.Sometimes you just know that God has a sense of humor.Dr. Isabel Favor, author of Four Cornerstones for a Favorable Life, has sacrificed everything to build her self-help empire. Then, in a matter of weeks, it all comes crashing down. She loses her money to an unscrupulous accountant, her fiancé to a frumpy older woman, and her reputation to headlines denouncing her as a fraud. America's diva of self-help soon discovers she can fix everyone's life but her own. Broke, heartsick, and soul-weary, she heads for Italy in search of a little breathing room. Lorenzo Gage makes his living killing people... on the silver screen, that is. He's viciously handsome and sublimely talented. But as he begins his vacation in Italy, he's also vaguely dissatisfied. Being a villain with a face to die for has its rewards, but he hates the feeling that everything he's neglected in life is catching up with him. Then he spots Isabel sipping a glass of wine in a sidewalk café. A good guy wouldn't think of seducing such a tidy-looking woman... but he'd never seen the fun in playing the hero.It doesn't take long for Isabel to realize she's escaped one kind of chaos only to be plunged into another. Even the shelter of a simple stone farmhouse nestled in a Tuscan olive grove can't provide her with the refuge she needs—not when the townspeople are scheming to drive her away, and her plan to restore her reputation has come up empty. And especially not when the man who deceived her refuses to leave her in peace.Breathing Room is a book for any woman who's dreamed of wandering through a vineyard, of lazing under the Tuscan sky, or of reforming a deliciously wicked man. This is a story of hope and renewal, of love and redemption when it's needed the most. Sometimes it takes a special place... a special love... a little breathing room... for life to deliver all its glorious promise."," Fiction , Romance , General",Avon,"Tuesday, April 1, 2003",Price Starting at $5.29
"Taste Berries for Teens: Inspirational Short Stories and Encouragement on Life, Love, Friendship and Tough Issues","By Youngs, Bettie B. (EDT) and Youngs, Jennifer Leigh (EDT)","The Richardella-dulcisica, better known as the taste berry, is a unique fruit. When eaten, it causes the taste buds to experience all food eaten afterwards-even distasteful food-as sweet and delicious. Likewise, there are people who, through their love and compassion, make the lives of others better. Like the taste berry, these people can turn sour days into delightful, even joyful, ones. With all the confusion, turmoil and heartache that teens experience, they need ""taste berries"" more than any other group. The authors - a mother/daughter team sensitive to the special needs of teens- have collected a wide array of inspirational material, which they interweave with teens' comments and critiques. The book is divided into units on self-worth, self-respect and self-esteem; friendship; love and meaningful relationships; finding meaning, purpose and direction in life; giving, sharing and making a difference; encouragement and success; and coping with pressure, stress and tough issues. Real teens reviewed this book and the authors completed it with the collaborative feedback of those teens. This innovative approach enables Taste Berries for Teens to show teens - by means of the responses and reactions of their peers, rather than the rhetoric of adults - what it means to be a ""taste berry"" and to appreciate the ""taste berries"" in their lives.

Letters to My Daughter: A Father Writes About Torah and the Jewish Woman,"By Orenstein, Walter","Through a series of letters from a father to his college-age daughter, Dr. Walter Orenstein traces the role and the history of women in the Torah and shows, through text and commentary, that in traditional Jewish society the status of women is equal to that of men, though their function is often quite different. Letters to My Daughter: A Father Writes about Torah and the Jewish Woman introduces the reader to the Oral Law, to the exciting realm of Halakhah, and to some of the essential principles of Jewish philosophy.Although this work is addressed to a college student, it is meant for all women and men regardless of their backgrounds. Those who have a limited background in Jewish studies and seek an understanding of the principles of Jewish belief and the way that these principles impact upon her or his life will find this book a useful beginning to the world of Jewish scholarship.Those students whose Jewish education has taken them far beyond the rudiments of Torah knowledge but who are concerned with the status of women in Orthodox Judaism and lack the training to probe the sources on their own will find this book enlightening.This book also addresses itself to the Jewish man or woman who was raised in the secular world but who now searches for truth, meaning, and purpose in the Torah, hoping that its words will provide spiritual guidance, personal insight, and divine wisdom."," Religion , Judaism , Sacred Writings","Jason Aronson, Inc.","Sunday, October 1, 1995",Price Starting at $4.99
